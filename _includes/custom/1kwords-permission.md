Hi, Radu. Would it be ok if I mentioned your video on my (very humble and modest) website (Github Pages)?

**Radu Dumitrescu (zerosapte):**

Sure it would, I would be delighted.

**Mart Betᴢ (martbetz):**

Just edited the origional post, would you still be ok with the suggested?

**Radu Dumitrescu (zerosapte):**

Of course, afaic it’s free publicity, so, if anything, I should be thanking you. So thanks.

**Mart Betᴢ (martbetz):**
