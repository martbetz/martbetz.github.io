      For the most part, 'about' pages are as pointless as they are irritating. Nothing I could write here would be of any real interest to anyone â€” as far as the website goes, I'm sure you can work it out for yourself; as for it's author, you'll learn as much therein as I'll ever care to relate.

      I've no intention of wasting your time or insulting your intelligence; this website is nothing more than a pitiful example of self-indulgence â€” one day, though, these pretty little pictures and funny little words will be all that's left of me; so for that, I make no apology.
