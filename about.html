      Nothing I could write here would be of any real interest to anyone (for the most part, ‘about’ pages are as pointless as they are irritating). As far as the website goes, I’m sure you can work it out for yourself; as for it’s author, you’ll learn as much therein as I’ll ever care to relate.¹

      I’ve no intention of wasting your time or insulting your intelligence; this website is nothing more than a shameless portayal of self-indulgence (but for that, I blatantly refuse to apologise; some day, these silly little words and funny little pictures will be all that’s left of me).
