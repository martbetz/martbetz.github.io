      For the most part, ‘about’ pages are as pointless as they are irritating. Nothing I could write here would be of any real interest to anyone&nbsp;— as far as the website goes, I’m sure you can work it out for yourself;¹ as for it’s author, you’ll learn as much therein as I’ll ever care to relate.

      I’ve no intention of wasting your time or insulting your intelligence; this website is nothing more than a shameless portayal of self-indulgence&nbsp;— but for that, I blatantly refuse to apologise; some day, these silly little words and funny little pictures will be all that’s left of me.
