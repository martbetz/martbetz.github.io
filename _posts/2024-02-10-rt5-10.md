### What's new? ###

Lost of stuff; you can find all the details in the [release&nbsp;notes](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/blob/6967de2f89d5b49b5818f4afa27aa0f941b4028f/RELEASE_NOTES.txt).

### Any issues? ###

I've not had a chance to test it just yet (I'm a bit tied up at work); as soon as I get the chance, though, I'll be sure to post an [update](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/rawtherapee-5-10-release-candidate-1-ready/42051/8?u=martbetz).

### When will the official release be available? ###

<s>Anytime now, according to the 5.10 roadmap. In the meantime, why not download [5.10-rc1](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/rawtherapee-5-10-release-candidate-1-ready/42051) for yourself and give it a whirl? Builds are currently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</s>
