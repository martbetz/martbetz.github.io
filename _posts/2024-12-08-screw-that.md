title: Screw That!

Buying cheap tools is rarely a good idea, but several hundred quid for drivers? 😲 Surely there must be a middle ground? Well, as it turns out, there is&nbsp;— <i>but you really need to know what to look for and where you need to look to find it.</i> 

When choosing a watchmaker’s screwdriver set, quality is king; the only problem is, quality comes at a price&nbsp;— and the price of a quality set these days can just be plain darn crazy!

The good news is, quality drivers <i>do</i> exist at reasonable price points; the bad news is, they’re scarce; especially in a market saturated by cheap and nasty rubbish. 

So how do you sort the wheat from the chaff? Well, have a read of this: [Best Watchmakers Screwdrivers for Beginners](https://wahawatches.com/best-watchmaker-screwdrivers-for-beginners/) by Melvin Hollenburg (wahawatches.com).

Thank’s to Melvin’s advice, I was able to narrow things down. Two close contenders were a nine-piece set by [Cousins UK (S57442)](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/cousins-swiss-style-sets-rotating-stands#) and a five-piece set by [Horotec SA (MSA01.095)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KD89-Watchmakers-Screwdrivers-Chrome-Plated-0-60-0-80-1-00-1-2-1-4/dp/B0C945P8D1), but I finally settled on a seven-piece set by [Beco Technic (205941)](https://www.beco-technic.com/en/7-screwdrivers-0-6-2-0-mm-blastic-box-with-spare-blades/205941). 

They’re winging it in from Germany as we speak, and all for the price of £35 (including postage and packing)&nbsp;— <i>so be sure to check back for an update, now, Bob!</i>

Update (Dec 13, 2024): Hold the fort! The delivery turned up today, and I’m really disappointed&nbsp;— as soon as I opened the packaging, I could tell that something was up.&nbsp;🤨

Despite being sealed up and labeled, the drivers were awkwardly mounted. When I took the seal off, the plastic box sprang open and everything fell to the floor!&nbsp;😣

The drivers don’t fit in the case; it’s as simple as that&nbsp;— would a brand like Beco Technics <i>really</i> overlook such an obvious flaw, or has this lot been swapped out for [knock-offs](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/)?&nbsp;🤔

I don’t have a whole lot of faith in these, so I’ll simply have to return them. I may well try the Cousins set&nbsp;— these ones come with a nice little stand and work out slightly cheaper.
