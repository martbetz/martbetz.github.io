title: Screw That!

Buying cheap tools is rarely a good idea, but several hundred quid for drivers? 😲 Surely there must be a middle ground? Well, as it turns out, there is — <i>but you really need to know what to look for and where you need to look to find it.</i> 

When choosing a watchmaker’s screwdriver set, quality is king; the only problem is, quality comes at a price — <i>and the price of a quality set these days can just be plain darn crazy!</i>

The good news is, quality drivers <i>do</i> exist at reasonable price points; the bad news is, they’re scarce; especially in a market saturated by cheap and nasty rubbish. 

So how do you sort the wheat from the chaff? Well, have a read of this: [Best Watchmakers Screwdrivers for Beginners](https://wahawatches.com/best-watchmaker-screwdrivers-for-beginners/) by Melvin Hollenburg (wahawatches.com).

Thank’s to Melvin’s advice, I was able to narrow things down. Two close contenders were a nine-piece set by [Cousins UK (S57442)](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/cousins-swiss-style-sets-rotating-stands#) and a five-piece set by [Horotec SA (MSA01.095)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KD89-Watchmakers-Screwdrivers-Chrome-Plated-0-60-0-80-1-00-1-2-1-4/dp/B0C945P8D1), but I finally settled on a seven-piece set by [Beco Technic (205941)](https://www.beco-technic.com/en/7-screwdrivers-0-6-2-0-mm-blastic-box-with-spare-blades/205941). 

They’re winging it in from Germany as we speak, and all for the price of £35 (including postage and packing)&nbsp;— <i>so be sure to check back for an update, now, Bob!</i>

<b>UPDATE (Dec 13, 2024): HOLD THE FORT!</b> The drivers turned up today, and I’m really not impressed. As soon as I opened the packaging, I could tell something was up.

All of the drivers, although in sealed wrapping, weren’t sitting right in the box. When I took off the seal, the plastic case sprang open and everthing jumped on the floor. 

These were purchased from Amazon, and I wonder if they’re even genuine. The tips look good and the case is definately branded, but I’m not so sure of the handles. I just can’t trust these; [back to square one?](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/precision-screwdrivers/47032)

After some reflection, I've decided to teturn them. Would a company that's highly regarded for their quality tools, <i>really</i> fail to notice that the case won't close and the inserts aren't straight? Or is it more likely that the handles have been swapped out for fakes that the case wasn't designed to hold?
