Buying cheap tools is rarely a good idea, but several hundred quid for drivers? 😲 Surely there must be a middle ground? Well, as it turns out, there is — <i>but you really need to know what to look for and where you need to look to find it.</i> 

When choosing a watchmaker’s screwdriver set, quality is king; the only problem is, quality comes at a price — <i>and the price of a quality set these days can just be plain darn crazy!</i>

The good news is, quality drivers <i>do</i> exist at reasonable price points; the bad news is, they’re scarce; especially in a market saturated by cheap and nasty rubbish. 

So how do you sort the wheat from the chaff? Well, have a read of this: [Best Watchmakers Screwdrivers for Beginners](https://wahawatches.com/best-watchmaker-screwdrivers-for-beginners/) by Melvin Hollenburg (wahawatches.com).

Thank’s to Melvin’s advice, I was able to narrow things down. Two close contenders were a nine-piece set by [Cousins UK (S57442)](https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/cousins-swiss-style-sets-rotating-stands#) and a five-piece set by [KD89 (MSA01.095)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KD89-Watchmakers-Screwdrivers-Chrome-Plated-0-60-0-80-1-00-1-2-1-4/dp/B0C945P8D1), but I finally settled on a seven-piece set by [Beco Technic (205941)](https://www.beco-technic.com/en/7-screwdrivers-0-6-2-0-mm-blastic-box-with-spare-blades/205941). 

They’re winging it in from Germany as we speak, and all for the price of £35 (including postage and packing)&nbsp;— <i>so check back soon for an update, Bob!</i>
