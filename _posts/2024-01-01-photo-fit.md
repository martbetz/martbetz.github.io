I usually can't be bothered with new-year resolutions (which kind of defeats the whole purpose), but I'm making an exception today: I've decided to take up hiking. Shooting the street is demanding, and I need to get fit for the summer!

The great british weather is a pain in the shutter (all we ever get is rain), and it only gets worse in the winter. If you have the right stuff, this isn't a problem; if not, then shooting in the wet is a no go. 

None of my gear is rain proof, so I mostly shoot when it’s dry; while this isn’t an issue per se (I’ve many other interests to fill my time), I don’t get out and about much — <i>so I start to get fat, and start to get lazy!</i>

This year, then, I'm comitting to a cause. I've already taken part in a few short treks, with a few more planned next week. I'll be leaving my gear behind me, but this fella’s coming instead:

Are you ready, liddle buddy?

I'll be hiking some really cool places, so I'll have to take photos of some sort (maybe some video, too); besides, I'll be logging my progress right here (and this <i>is</i> a ‘photography’ blog after all).

So off I go to brave the storm. Lets hope my efforts pay off.
