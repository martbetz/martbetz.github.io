Need a better installer for Python packages? pipx is a free and open-source application manager that's easy to set up, easy to use, and runs directly from the CLI â€” _no more ugly version clashes for YOU, my young Bob!_

<h2>Why not use pip?</h2>

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installs Python packages directly to the main system Python environment; while this works fine for the short term, problems can arise over timeÂ¹ 

<h2>Why use pipx?</h2>

[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) installs each Python package to a seperate virtual Python environment; in turn, this completely removes the potential for any long-term issues. 

<h2>Sounds complicated!</h2>

Far from it; pipx is no more complicated than pip! All of the hard work (the creation of environments, the installation of apps, and the setup of executables) is conveniently and automatically taken care of.  

<h2>Great! Where can I find it?</h2>

If you're running Linux (and why wouldn't you be? ðŸ˜‰), you'll likely find pipx in at least one of your distro's repos; if not (or if the lastest version isn't available), you can find [pipx on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/). For macOS and Windows users, installation guides are available in the [pipx Github repo](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).
