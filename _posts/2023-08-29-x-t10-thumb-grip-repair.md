Notice the use of air quotes, here: the fact that my camera is 'getting up in years' is something I struggle to accept; I've had my X-T10 since 2015, and â€” _much to my protest!_ â€” the inevitable corollary of 'old age' has started creeping in.

### What's happened? ###

I was changing over the lens last week when I noticed the thumb grip had shifted; the fixing had failed over time, so an urgent repair was in order â€” _[lost Fuji thumb grips](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4343992) are an anoyingly common problem!_

### How did you fix it? ###

Re-attatching the thumb grip was relatively easy to do, but choosing the right adhesive required some careful thought; it was formally secured with transfer tape, but I couldn't tell for certain exactly which tape was used ([replacement grips from Fujifilm](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cjHktODe0qU&pp=ygUQeC10MTAgdGh1bWIgZ3JpcA%3D%3D) have a generic transparent baking, and I couldn't find the info anywhere on the web). 

### What did you use? ###

After a bit of research, I found an ideal fit: [300LSE transfer tape](https://technicaldatasheets.3m.com/en_US?pif=000044?locale=en-US) by a company called 3M; it was hard to find and expensive (here in the UK, at least), but ticked all the important boxes â€” _while a steadfast bond was critical, it had to be semi-permanent; fasteners fixed to the body are located directly beneath!_

### How did you go about it? ###

I disassembled the parts and cleaned off all the residue (using soapy water on the thumb grip, and a cotton bud and cloth on the mount). Once clean and dry, it was all put back together with the tape I'd cut to size.Â¹

### How's it holding up? ###

The adhesive strengthens with time, so I'll post an update soon. In the meantime, I've ordered extra [X-T10/XT-20 thumb grips](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&_nkw=fuji+x-t10+thumb+grip&_sacat=0) from ebay (just in case); I tried [reaching out to Fujifilm](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/stupid-is-as-stupid-does/35594/49?u=martbetz), but they told me they didn't sell spares (I was offered a [fix and full service](https://repairs.fujifilm.eu/en/pricing/?prodgroup=3), but it obviously cost a lot more).Â¹

Â¹ Once I've refined the process, I'll put together a guide.

Â² Â£156, to be exact, but at least it's still an option (the price includes all taxes, all parts and labour, full postage and packing, and a twelve-month warranty). ðŸ˜Š
