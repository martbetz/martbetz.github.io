Notice the use of air quotes, here: the fact that my snapper's 'getting up in years' is something I struggle to accept; I've only had it since 2015, yet — _much to my protest!_ — the inevitable corollary of 'old age' has already crept in.

### What's happened? ###

I was changing over the lens last week when I noticed the thumb grip had shifted; the fixing had failed over time, so an urgent repair was in order — _[lost Fuji thumb grips](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4343992) are an anoyingly common problem!_

### Could you fix it? ###

Re-attatching the thumb grip was relatively easy to do, but choosing the right adhesive required some careful thought; it was formally secured with transfer tape, but I couldn't tell for certain exactly which tape was used ([replacement grips from Fujifilm](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cjHktODe0qU&pp=ygUQeC10MTAgdGh1bWIgZ3JpcA%3D%3D) have a generic transparent baking, and I couldn't find the info anywhere on the web). 

### What did you use? ###

After a bit of research, I found an ideal fit: [300LSE transfer tape](https://technicaldatasheets.3m.com/en_US?pif=000044?locale=en-US) by a company called 3M; it was hard to find and somewhat expensive (here in the UK, at least), but it certainly ticked all the boxes — _while a steadfast bond was critical, it had to be semi-permanent; fasteners fixed to the body are located directly beneath!_

### How did you go about it? ###

I disassembled the parts and cleaned off all the residue (using soapy water on the thumb grip, and a cotton bud and cloth on the mount). Once clean and dry, it was all put back together with the tape I'd cut to size.¹

### How's it holding up? ###

The adhesive strengthens with time, so I'll post an update soon. In the meantime, I've ordered extra [X-T10/XT-20 thumb grips](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&_nkw=fuji+x-t10+thumb+grip&_sacat=0) from ebay (just in case).²

Update (20.10.2023): The fix is ok but not perfect; the adhesive will sometimes still losen during general everyday use. I may try adding more tape, or I may try using some [Pliobond®](https://ruscoe.com/products/adhesives/).
