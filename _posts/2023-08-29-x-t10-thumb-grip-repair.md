Notice the use of air quotes, here: the fact that my camera is 'getting up in years' is something I struggle to accept; I've had my X-T10 since 2015, and — _much to my protest!_ — the inevitable corollary of 'old age' has started creeping in.

I was changing over the lens last week when I noticed the thumb grip had shifted; it had worked it's way loose from the body (which apparently happens quite often), so a fix was obviously in order.

Re-attatching the thumb grip was a relatively simple repair, but using the right materials was fundamentally important; it was formally secured with bonding tape, but I couldn't tell for certain which type of tape was used ([replacement grips from Fujifilm](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cjHktODe0qU&pp=ygUQeC10MTAgdGh1bWIgZ3JpcA%3D%3D) have a generic transparent baking, and I couldn't find any info anywhere on the web). After careful consideration, I found an ideal fit: [300LSE bonding tape](https://technicaldatasheets.3m.com/en_US?pif=000044?locale=en-US) by a company called 3M (it was hard to find and expensive, but had all the properties I needed).

... to 'geriatric jelly disorder' 



I decided to tackle the most serious ailment first. Around a month ago, things took a turn for the worse, and the condition had progressed to full blown 'geriatric jelly disorder.' 

The next thing to tackle is the loose thumb grip. 

The original grip was fixed with double-sided transfer tape, so I decided to reattach it with some [3M 300SLE](https://technicaldatasheets.3m.com/en_US?pif=000044?locale=en-US) — _this stuff is both difficult to find and expensive, but (as is the case with most camera repairs) any attempt at a compromise will likely result in failure._ -->
