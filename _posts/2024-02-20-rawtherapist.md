How could Rawtherapee be better promoted? How could related developments be better communicated? How could related content be better collated and served?  Here's my modest attempt at a quick and simple solution. ðŸ˜Š

[RawTherapist](https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/homepage.html) is an experimental resource hub for [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com), and it's goal (as the smart-arsed name would suggest) is to save the sanity of users by making things easy to find.

Currently, the project consists of two parts (or sub-projects, if you prefer): a news page called [RawFocus](https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html) (another feeble effort at a witty play on words) and a page of organised links called [RawIndex](https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html) (the well of awful puns had by now run dry).

To break with my usual format, the pages are clean and basic; there aren't any headers or footers, and there aren't any menus or scripts (for several good reasons, but I won't bother to bore you with the details). 

From now on (or at least until further notice), all related content will be posted straight to the project (instead of being posted directly to my 'blog'). I can't provide a feed just yet (not a direct one, at least), but I'll work something out very soon.  

Anyway, I hope you find this stuff useful (if you don't, then try to be kind; I'm just a humble hippie with a Kindle and a camera ðŸ˜‰).
