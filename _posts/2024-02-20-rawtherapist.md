How could Rawtherapee be better promoted? How could related developments be better communicated? How could related content be better collated and served?  Here's my modest attempt at a quick and simple solution. ðŸ˜Š

[RawTherapist](https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/homepage.html) is an experimental resource hub for [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com), and it's goal (as the satirical name would suggest) is to save the sanity of users by making things easy to find.

Currently, the project consists of two parts (or sub-projects, if you prefer): a news page called [RawFocus](https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html) (another feeble effort at a witty play on words) and a page of organised links called [RawIndex](https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html) (the smart-arsed pun well had finally dried up).

To break with my usual format, the pages are clean and basic (no fancy headers or footers, and no multi-pages or scripts); while the project forms part of my website for now, it may get a home of it's own some day (or it may just die a quiet and lonely death; only time will tell).

From now on (or at least until further notice) any future RawTherapee stuff will be posted straight to the project (instead, that is, of being posted to my website's 'blog'); I hope you find it useful (if not, then at least be kind; after all, I'm just a hippie with a camera ðŸ˜‰).
