Traveling without my camera is hard to come to terms with. Apart from the obvious, Iâ€™ve several (for me) very good reasons for taking my snapper everywhere; this time, though, Iâ€™m leaving it at home â€” <i>much to my begrudged discomfort.</i>

Itâ€™s a pretty straightforward work trip (bus, train, taxi, work, taxi, hotel, taxi, work, taxi, train, bus; a one-night stay, no changes, and a four-hour journey each way), but Iâ€™m a very anxious traveler â€” and I mean <i>very</i> anxious; Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll get the wrong train, Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll lose my wallet, Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll get lost, Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll get the squats or my arms and legs stop working... I worry about <i>everything!</i>

The less I have to worry about, then, the better; Iâ€™ll travel like one should invest, and Iâ€™ll risk the dispensables only (I couldnâ€™t give a fig if my work phone got nicked or my laptop got crushed, but Iâ€™d constantly be nervous of my camera). Iâ€™ll also be traveling lighter, which means a smaller backpack (so Iâ€™ve something I can keep right beside me without it being impractical). 

There is one major downside, though (again, apart from the obvious): without my camera bag, I've nowhere to keep my wallet, passport, personal phone, tickets, or other such critical items (Iâ€™ve got a few pockets, but theyâ€™re none of them convenient or secure); then thereâ€™s my puffer, and Iâ€™ve no idea where to put that... 

Dagnabbit, and to heck with it! I'm taking the darn camera! ðŸ˜£
