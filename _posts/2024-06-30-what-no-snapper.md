Traveling without my camera is hard to come to terms with. Apart from the obvious, I’ve several (for me) very good reasons for taking my snapper everywhere; this time, though, I’m leaving it at home — <i>much to my begrudged discomfort.</i>

It’s a pretty straightforward trip (bus, train, taxi, work, taxi, hotel, taxi, work, taxi, train, bus; a one-night stay, no changes, and a four-hour journey each way), but I’m a very anxious traveler — and I mean <i>very</i> anxious; I’m worried I’ll get the wrong train, I’m worried I’ll lose my wallet, I’m worried I’ll get lost, I’m worried I’ll get the shits or my arms and legs stop working... I worry about <i>everything!</i>

The less I have to worry about, then, the better; I’ll travel like one should invest, and I’ll risk the dispensables only (I couldn’t give a fig if my work phone got nicked or my laptop got cruched, but I’d constantly be nervous of my camera). I’ll also be traveling lighter, which means a smaller backpack (so I’ve something I can keep right beside me without it being impractical). 

There is one major downside, though (again, apart from the obvious): without my camera bag, I've nowhere to keep my wallet, passport, personal phone, tickets, or other such critical items (I’ve got a few pockets, but they’re none of them convenient or secure); then there’s my puffer, and I’ve no idea where to put that. I don’t want to put everything in my backpack as I can't keep an eye on it, and... 

You know what? To hell with it; I'm taking the flaming camera!
