I've managed to trash my OS (at one in the morning!), and I'm currently restoring everything from a Time Machine backup; it's not the first time I've had to do this (and it likely won't be the last), but it never gets less nerve racking!

I was doing a bit of spring cleaning, and delted a file I shouldn't have; then, if that wasn't bad enough, I managed to fatally compounded the problem by botching my attempt at restoring it. Luckily, I ran a backup not too long ago.

Thankfully, good old Time Machine has saved my bacon yet again; I can now rest easy (after a thurough test, everything appears to be as expected). Backing stuff up is so imprtant; you never know when something catastrophic might hapâ€”
