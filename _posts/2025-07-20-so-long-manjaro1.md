I’ve used Manjaro since always, but I’ve now switched over to Arch. I’ve never been one to distro hop, but my hand was somewhat forced — and, now that I <i>have</i>, there’s certainly no turning back.

I noticed something strange in RawTherapee; the results when applying my custom PP3s differed from version to version. I just went with it at first, presuming it was down to changes and tweaks to the way RawTherapee worked; it turns out, though, it wasn't — when I tried it out on Arch, no such issues occured.

So that was it; that was the push I needed to set me on my way. Manjaro was always good to me, and things worked well for the most part, but I hankered for something simpler; something to call my own — I was just too lazy to sort it.&nbsp;😁 Now I’ve a system that’s blazing fast and works like an absolute charm — <i>we live in happier times, young Bob; we live in happier times.</i>&nbsp;😎
