I’ve used Manjaro since always, but I’ve now switched over to Arch. I’ve never been one to distro hop, but my hand was pretty much forced — and, now that I’m gone, I won’t be coming back.

I noticed something strange in RawTherapee; the results when applying my custom PP3s differed from version to version. I thought it was down to the changes; as it turns out, though, it wasn't — when I tried it out on Arch, everything worked as it should.

So that was it; that was the push I needed to set me on my way. Manjaro was always good to me, and things worked well for the most part, but I hankered for something simpler; something to call my own — I was just too lazy to sort it.&nbsp;😁 

Now I’ve a system that’s blazing fast and works like an absolute charm — <i>we live in happier times, young Bob; we live in happier times.</i>&nbsp;😎
