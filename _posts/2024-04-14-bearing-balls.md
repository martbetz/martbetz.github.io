For quite some time, now, there's been an ever-growing trend of 'de-clicking' vintage photography lenses for use in cinematography. Restoring them can be tricky; parts are often lost or discarded, and here's where I need your help.

Lenses are 'de-clicked' by removing the bearing ball from the aperture mechanism. In order to restore the origional function, a replacement needs to be sought; sizes, however, can significantly vary. 

While it's possible to source 'bearing ball kits' of varying sizes, quality is often an issue; as such, establishing the correct size for each lens is most important.

I'm attempting to make a reference list with the aim of recording the correct bearing ball sizes for the most common legacy lenses:

- SMC Pentax-M 50mm 1.7
   - 2.0mm ([pentaxforums.com](https://www.pentaxforums.com/forums/10-pentax-slr-lens-discussion/226394-aperture-ring-ball-bearing-size-availability-m50-1-7-a.html))

- Minolta Rokkor 58mm 1.2
   - 2.0mm ([fredmiranda.com](https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/749370))

So far, as you can see, it's a very small list indeed! If you can help in any way, I'd be very happy to hear from you. For now, you can shoot me an [email](https://martbetz.github.io/contact.html); if I can get this thing off the ground, I'll create a seperate project on GitHub.

To measure the balls accurately, you’ll need to use a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers">caliper</a>. Please don’t provide estimated measurements — <i>we’re talking small tolerances, here, so estimates are about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike!</i>
