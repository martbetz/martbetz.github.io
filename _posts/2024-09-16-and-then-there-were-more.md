I've decided to give The Promura Project a facelift. It's been eight months since I last posted an update, and the list of 28mm lenses has grown from 10 to 18!&nbsp;üçª To celebrate, I've now included seperate info pages for each example.

</div>

<p>
<font size="4">The objective of The Promura Project is to collate as much information as possible about two very obscure and rare camera lenses: the Auto-Promura 28mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC and the Auto-Promura 20mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC.¬π </font>
