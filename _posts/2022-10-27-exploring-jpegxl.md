title: Exploring the Potential of JXL

For as long as there's been digital photography, there's been JPEG&nbsp;— _it's been the standard digital photo format for over 30 years!_&nbsp;— but its direct sucessor, JPEG XL, is finally here (and it could even replace PNG and GIF, too).

### Why replace JPEG? ###

The **J**oint **P**hotographic-**E**xperts **G**roup format has been a mainstay of digital imagery since 1992; yet, despite its unprecedented popularity, it's never really offered a _complete_ solution for digital photographers. 

### How does JPEG XL address this? ###

The **J**oint **P**hotographic-**E**xperts **G**roup **X** **L**ong-Term format 😳 brings _a lot_ of new features to the table: support for wide colour gamuts and high bit-depths, alpha channel and multi-layer image support, lossless compression and significantly-improved lossy compression, and advanced progressive decoding.¹

### How do the results compare? ###

The following chart shows the comparative file sizes when following my typical workflow. In order to create and display the JXLs, I installed the [qt6-jpegxl-image-plugin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qt6-jpegxl-image-plugin) from the AUR.² I used an intermediate TIF as both a reference point and as a  'stepping stone' between RawTherapee and Krita.³

</div>

For my typical use case (blue), the difference in file size was 1.42 MB—&nbsp; _that's a reduction of over 60%!_ Likewise, when compared to PNG (red), the difference in file size was 1.68 MB&nbsp;— _an equally  impressive reduction of 43%!_ 

It's also worth noting the comparison between the JPG and the _lossless_ JXL, the later being 0.16MB smaller than the former&nbsp;— _in other words, the LOSSLESS JPEG XL is almost 7% lighter than the LOSSY JPEG!_ 

As far as image quality goes, I could see no discernible difference right accross the board (no surprises here, though, given that the highest quality settings were used for both the JPEG and the lossy JPEG XL).

### When will adoption role out? ###

JPEG XL has already been finalised, but it will likely take some time to gain traction; none of the popular web browsers support it just yet (not by default, at least), but here's to hoping that changes very soon.⁴ ⁵

² My weapon of choice is KDE Manaro, so this was a no-brainer — _support was added to all my KDE apps, as well as <a href="https://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> and <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org">feh</a>, in less than two minutes!_&nbsp;😍️
