Need an alternative to Hugin? xpano is a free and open-source photo sticher that's been causing quite a stir&nbsp;â€” _and for very good reason; with a focus on function and simplicity, it certainly has the potential to fill a long-neglected niche_.

If you've never heard of [xpano](https://github.com/krupkat/xpano) before, consider yourself excused; it's pretty much a brand new project (in fact, it was only a few weeks ago&nbsp;â€” <i>after being discovered completely by chance!</i>&nbsp;â€” that it was added to the pixls.us website). 

Panoramic images aren't too common in street photography (maybe we should change all that? ðŸ¤”), so I haven't used xpano a great deal myself; judging by the general feedback, though, it's certainly gaining kudos from a lot of early adopters. 

Here's to wishing [TomÃ¡Å¡ Krupka](https://krupkat.cz) all the best in his venture, and I sincerely hope that xpano goes from strength to strength. If you'd like to show some love, be sure to stop by the new [xpano thread](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/xpano/42) on the pixls.us forum.Â¹

Â¹ Thanks to [Sebastian Guyader](https://discuss.pixls.us/u/sguyader/summary), we also have a working [xpano PKGBUILD](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=285253); however, we're having a bit of trouble getting it ready for the AUR ([Github issue #85](https://github.com/krupkat/xpano/issues/85)) â€” <i>if you could offer any help with this, please give us a shout! </i>
