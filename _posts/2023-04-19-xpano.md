Need an alternative to Hugin? xpano is a free and open-source photo sticher that's been causing quite a stir&nbsp;â€” _and for very good reason; with a focus on simplicity and ease-of-use, it certainly has the potential to fill a very important niche!_

If you've never heard of [xpano](https://github.com/krupkat/xpano) before, you're completely excused; it hasn't been around for very long at all; in fact, it was only a few weeks ago that it was introduced on the pixls.us forum. 

I've not used xpano much myself (panoramic images aren't too common in my particular genre), but the numerous examples I've seen so far look very good indeed.

Here's to wishing [TomÃ¡Å¡ Krupka](https://krupkat.cz) all the best in his venture, and I sincerely hope the project goes from strength to strength. If you'd like to show some love, be sure to stop by the [xpano thread](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/xpano/42) on pixls.us.Â¹

Â¹ We're currently in the process of putting a [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD)  together, but we're having a bit of trouble getting it to work. If you could offer any help at all, please give us a shout (when it comes to this sort of stuff, I'm affraid I'm as useless as an ashtray on a motorbike ðŸ˜’).
