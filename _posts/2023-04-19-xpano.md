Need an alternative to Hugin? xpano is a free and open-source photo sticher that's been causing quite a stir&nbsp;â€” _and for very good reason; with a focus on function and simplicity, it certainly has the potential to fill a long-neglected niche!_

If you've never heard of [xpano](https://github.com/krupkat/xpano) before, consider yourself excused; it's pretty much a brand new project (in fact, it was only a few weeks ago that it was discovered â€” completely by chance â€” on GitHub and subsequently introduced on the pixls.us forum). 

Panoramic images aren't too common in street photography (maybe we should change all that? ðŸ¤”), so I haven't used xpano that much myself; judging by the general feedback, though, it's certainly gaining kudos from some early adopters. 

Here's to wishing [TomÃ¡Å¡ Krupka](https://krupkat.cz) all the best in his venture, and I sincerely hope the project goes from strength to strength. If you'd like to show some love, be sure to stop by the [xpano thread](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/xpano/42) on pixls.us.Â¹

Â¹ We're currently in the process of putting a [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD)  together, but we're having a bit of trouble getting it to work. If you could offer any help at all, please give us a shout (when it comes to this sort of stuff, I'm about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike ðŸ˜’).

UPDATE: Thanks to all the hard work of [Sebastian Guyader](https://discuss.pixls.us/u/sguyader/summary), we now have a working [xpano PKGBUILD](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/xpano-0-11-0-thank-you/36484/47?u=martbetz)!
