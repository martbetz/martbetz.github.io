Woo-hoo! It’s that time of the year when the snapper comes out, and my first main day of the season is a demo march down in Barry. Planning such things can be a right pain in the shutter as details are often sketchy&nbsp;— this time, though, things are looking up!

Nothing angers me more so than poorly promoted events; finding things to go to is often surprisingly painful. Second on my list would be shody information; incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date content being all to markedly common. 

Imagine my absolute glee, then, when my very first websearch showed this: [https://www.yes.cymru/barry](https://www.yes.cymru/barry).

I have to give credit where due, here; not only was it easy to find this page, but the content’s quite simply sublime — everything’s in there and far more besides; they’ve even included a Google-mapped route plan! 

You won’t see me there, but I’ll see you. Look amazing. 😁
