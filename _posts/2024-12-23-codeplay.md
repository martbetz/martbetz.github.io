Itâ€™s been quiet these past few days (itâ€™s the start of the Christmas holidays, and everythigâ€™s been winding down), so Iâ€™ve been playing around with the website; there were several things I needed to do, and Iâ€™ve finally made a start. 

The first is change to the subtitle â€” I was never completely happy with the other one, and I think the new one is clearer; it looks better and flows easier, too. The title page, footers, and copyright details have all been updated to reflect the relevant changes.

Iâ€™ve also reined in my unruly category and tab use. All posts now show categories under the date stamp that link to the matching section of a newly-created [Posts by Category](https://martbetz.github.io/categories/) page; in turn, this page includes a tag cloud that links to a new [Post by Tag](https://martbetz.github.io/tags/)  page. To help me flesh things out in a much more efficient way, I'm working on a [tab tree](https://github.com/martbetz/martbetz.github.io/blob/main/post-tree.md) as we speak.

Enjoy. ðŸ˜Ž
