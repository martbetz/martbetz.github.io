Itâ€™s been quiet these past few days (itâ€™s the start of the Christmas holidays, and everythigâ€™s been winding down), so Iâ€™ve been playing around with the website; there were several things I needed to do, and Iâ€™ve finally made a start. 

The first is a change to the subtitle (I was never completely happy with the other one, and I think the new one is clearer; it looks better and flows easier, too). The title page, footers, and copyright details have all been updated to reflect the changes.

Iâ€™ve also reined in my unruly (mis)use of categories and tabs. All posts now show categories under the date stamp that link to the matching section of a newly-created [Posts by Category](https://martbetz.github.io/categories/) page; in turn, this page includes a tag cloud that links to a new [Posts by Tag](https://martbetz.github.io/tags/RawTherapee/) index. To help me flesh things out in a much more efficient way, I'm working on a [tab tree](https://github.com/martbetz/martbetz.github.io/blob/main/post-tree.md); Iâ€™ll add more categories and tabs once Iâ€™ve finished my Cristmas turky. ðŸ¦ƒ

Enjoy.
