Woo-hoo! It’s that time of the year when the snapper comes out, and my first main day of the season is a demo march in Barry. Planning such things can be a right pain in the shutter as details are often sketchy&nbsp;— this time, though, things are looking up!

Nothing angers me more so than poorly promoted events; finding things to go to is more than often painful. Second on my list would be downright shody info; incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date content being all to markedly common.

Imagine my absolute glee, then, when my very first websearch showed this: <a href="https://www.yes.cymru/barry">https://www.yes.cymru/barry</a>.

I have to give credit where due, here; not only was it easy to find this page, but the content’s quite simply sublime — there’s even a Google-mapped street plan that shows the whole scope of the route!

It looks like the weather’s onside, so I’ll certainly make it a day. You won’t see me, but I’ll see you — so try to make sure you’re amazing!&nbsp;😁
