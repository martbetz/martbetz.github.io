I witnessed something odd today. I was sitting in my living room, looking out of the window, when a shiny silver sphere moved across the sky; then it stopped on a dime. By the time I'd reached for my snapper, the object had already gone.

The sighting was brief, lasting twenty seconds at most, but it happened in broad daylight. Whatever the object was, it looked *exactly* like a giant [bearing ball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(bearing));Â¹ before it stopped, it was moving at a notably brisk pace. Very strange indeed.&nbsp;ðŸ‘¾ðŸ¤”

  Â¹ As the the jocular reference attests, the irony isnâ€™t lost on me: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz_mystery_sphere">the Betz mystery sphere</a>. ðŸ˜‰
