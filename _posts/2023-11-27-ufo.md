I saw a UFO today. I was sitting in my living room, looking out of the window, when a shiny silver sphere moved across the sky; then it stopped on a dime. By the time I'd reached for my snapper, the UFO was nowhere in sight.

It only lasted a few seconds, and I saw it in broad daylight; it was travelling quite fast, and it looked like a huge ball bearing.Â¹ I thought it was a balloon at first, but balloons don't stop dead in the air. Weird. ðŸ‘½

Â¹ Next chance I get, I'll sketch a quick mock-up.
