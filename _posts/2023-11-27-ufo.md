I witnessed something odd today. I was sitting in my living room, looking out of the window, when a shiny silver sphere moved across the sky; then it stopped on a dime. By the time I'd reached for my snapper, the object was already gone.

The sighting was brief, only lasting a few seconds, and happened in broad daylight. Whatever it was, it was travelling quite fast; it looked exactly like a giant ball bearing.Â¹ I thought it was a balloon at first, but balloons don't stop dead in the air. Weird. ðŸ‘½

Â¹ Next chance I get, I'll sketch a quick mock-up.
