I witnessed something odd today. I was sitting in my living room, looking out of the window, when a shiny silver sphere moved across the sky; then it stopped on a dime. By the time I'd reached for my snapper, the object had already gone.

The sighting was brief, lasting twenty seconds at most, but it happened in broad daylight.Â¹ Whatever the object was, it looked *exactly* like a giant [bearing ball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(bearing)); before it stopped, it was moving at a notably brisk pace. Very strange indeed.&nbsp;ðŸ‘¾

Â¹ Next chance I get, I'll sketch a quick mock-up.
