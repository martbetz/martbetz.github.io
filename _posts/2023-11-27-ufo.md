I saw a UFO today (or UAP, if you prefer). I was sitting in my living room, looking out of the window, when a shiny silver sphere moved across the sky; then it stopped on a dime. I reached for my snapper, but it was already gone.

It only lasted a few seconds. It was travelling quite fast, and it looked like a huge ball bearing.Â¹ I thought it was a balloon at first, but balloons don't stop dead in the air. I saw it broad daylight. Weird. ðŸ‘½

Â¹ The next chance I get, I'll sketch mock-up and post it here.
