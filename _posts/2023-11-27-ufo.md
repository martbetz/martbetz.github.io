I saw a UFO today. I was sitting in my living room, looking out of the window, when a shiney metalic silver sphere moved across the sky; then it stopped on a dime. I reached for my snapper, but it was already gone.

It only lasted a few seconds. It was travelling quite fast, and it looked like a huge ball bearing. I thought it was a balloon at first, but balloons don't stop dead in the air. Weird. ðŸ‘½
