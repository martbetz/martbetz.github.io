I’m not a hard-core hiker; I’m more a part-time rambler, so I’ve not worn much of anything designed for the task in hand. Recently, though, I swapped my everyday cotton shirts for polyester hiking ones&nbsp;— will they really make a difference?

I’ve always gone a wandering in plain old cotton t-shirts; they’re what I’ve had to hand, and I couldn’t see any practical need for anything more exotic&nbsp;— I’m only a part-time bimbler, I don’t do any camping, and I’m mostly out in the summer (I’m also stubbornly hyper-adverse and downright frustratingly frugal&nbsp;😁).

Just the other day, though, I spotted some tops on sale; they were dedicated hiking shirts, made of lightweight polyester, apparently very ‘breathable’ and ‘moisure-wicking,’ and very quick-drying to boot. As the price was right, and I needed new t-shirts anyway, I went and picked one up.

The fit seems bang on the money, and it’s very nice next to the skin; it even looks somewhat flattering (which came as the biggest surprise!), and the quality’s certainly there. So far, I’m very much impressed. Time to give it a spin, then&nbsp;— I’ll be back very soon with an update.

Update (Apr 26, 2025): It was quite a warm day, today; not an absolute scorcher, but most certainly hot enough for a test run. I definately felt comfortable; the top was not only cool, but very soft next to my skin, very light, and my back (which in a cotton shirt gets absolutely sodden) was only slightly damp before drying almost instantly. 

Performance-wise, then, I was very pleased indeed&nbsp;— it even kept me cool despite the dark colour, which I thought would at least get very warm in the sun. The only downside I’ve  noticed is it tends to easily snag; my cotton shirts will stand up to anything, but this thing’s an absolute wimp&nbsp;— <i>best stay away from those brambles, then, Bob!</i>

So, have I been won over? Partially; I’ll certainly be getting some more. The term ‘horses for courses’ springs to mind though; they’ll be a worthwhile addition to my wardrobe, but not a direct replacement.
