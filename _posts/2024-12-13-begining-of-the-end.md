Although Iâ€™m not a â€˜believerâ€™ (Iâ€™m more a remourceful skeptic), Iâ€™ve always had an interest in all things strange and unknown.&nbsp;ðŸ‘½ Paranormal podcasts have always been on my watchlist, but this yearâ€™s been rather forlorn.&nbsp;ðŸ˜ž

Of all the shows Iâ€™ve tuned into, there were two I intensely enjoyed: [The Unexplained](https://theunexplained.tv/) with Howard Hughes, and [Mysterious Universe](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/) with Aaran Wright and Benjamin Grundy.

Earlier last month, I was mournfully shocked and saddened to hear of [Howardâ€™s passing](https://theunexplained.tv/episodes/an-important-update-about-howard-november-2024). The absence of his presence, leaves a horribly deafening silence. 

As for Mysterious Universe, [Aaron and Ben are due to step down](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriousUniverse/comments/1hd9ner/ben_and_aaron_are_retiring_as_mu_hosts/?rdt=46651) by the end of play next year. Whether the show will continue or not is, as yet, uncertain.
