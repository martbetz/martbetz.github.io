Although Iâ€™m not a â€˜believerâ€™ (Iâ€™m more a remourceful skeptic), Iâ€™ve always had an interest in all things strange and unknown. ðŸ‘½ Paranormal podcasts have always been on my watchlist, but this year just hasnâ€™t been good. ðŸ˜ž

Of all the podcasts Iâ€™ve listened to over the years, there were two in particular that I thoroughly enjoyed: [The Unexplained](https://theunexplained.tv/) with Howard Hughes, and [Mysterious Universe](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/) with Benjamin Grundy and Aaran Wright.

Earlier last month, I was both shocked and saddened to hear of [Howardâ€™s sudden passing](https://theunexplained.tv/episodes/an-important-update-about-howard-november-2024). The absence of his podcast, radio show, and TV show leaves a horribly deafening silence. 

As for Mysterious Universe, both [Ben and Aaron are due to step down](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriousUniverse/comments/1hd9ner/ben_and_aaron_are_retiring_as_mu_hosts/?rdt=46651) by the end of play next year. Whether the show will continue or not, albiet with different hosts, is as yet uncertain.

Are we witnessing the end of an era?
