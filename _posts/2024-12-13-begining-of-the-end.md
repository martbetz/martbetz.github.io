Iâ€™m not a blind believer, Iâ€™m very much the skeptic, but Iâ€™ve always had an interest in all things strange and unusual.&nbsp;ðŸ‘½ I regularly check in on several favourate shows, but that will soon be changing â€” which is very sad indeed.

Of all the podcasts Iâ€™ve listened to over the years, there were two in particular that I thoroughly enjoyed: [The Unexplained](https://theunexplained.tv/) with Howard Hughes, and [Mysterious Universe](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/) with Benjamin Grundy and Aaran Wright.

Earlier last month, I was both shocked and saddened to hear of [Howardâ€™s sudden passing](https://theunexplained.tv/episodes/an-important-update-about-howard-november-2024). The absence of his podcast, radio show, and TV show leaves a horribly deafening silence. 

As for Mysterious Universe, both [Ben an Aaron are due to step down](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/listen) by the end of play next year. Whether the show will continue or not, albiet with different hosts, is as yet uncertain.

Are we seeing the end of an era?
