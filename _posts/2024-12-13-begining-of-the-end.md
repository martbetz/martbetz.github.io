title: Begining of the End?

Although I’m not a ‘believer’ (I’m more a remourceful skeptic), I’ve always had an interest in all things strange and mysterious; paranormal podcasts are always on my watchlist. 👽 2024, though, just hasn’t been a good year.

Of all the podcasts I’ve listened to over the years, there were two in particular that I thoroughly enjoyed: [The Unexplained](https://theunexplained.tv/) with Howard Hughes, and [Mysterious Universe](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/) with Benjamin Grundy and Aaran Wright.

Earlier last month, I was both shocked and saddened to hear of [Howard’s sudden passing](https://theunexplained.tv/episodes/an-important-update-about-howard-november-2024). The absence of his podcast, radio show, and TV show leaves a horribly deafening silence. 

As for Mysterious Universe, both [Ben and Aaron are due to step down](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriousUniverse/comments/1hd9ner/ben_and_aaron_are_retiring_as_mu_hosts/?rdt=46651) by the end of play next year. Whether the show will continue or not, albiet with different hosts, is as yet uncertain.

Are we witnessing the end of an era?
