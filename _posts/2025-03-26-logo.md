For the past couple of months, Iâ€™ve been busy doing nothing; it comes as no surprise, then, that stuffâ€™s been piling up. I did have time to get a logo done, though, and I'll get it added soon. So, ladies and gents, Iâ€™d like you to meet Bob!

<div>
  <center>
     <img style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 25px;" width="400px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martbetz/martbetz.github.io/refs/heads/main/_includes/custom/bob_avatar_square.png" alt="Bob">
  </center>
</div>

While the current logo will stay, it was never meant as the main one; itâ€™s actually the siteâ€™s favicon logo thatâ€™s been plugging a hole in the short term. Likewise, Iâ€™ll also be updating my avatar.

It took me a while to make up my mind, but I now have something Iâ€™m cool with. As soon as Iâ€™ve got the important things done (updates, backups, and some real-world stuff), Iâ€™ll get the site updated.

Update (Mar 27, 2025): VoilÃ ! Job done! His hadsome little mugâ€™s on the home screen!

Just a gentle reminder, though, that Bobâ€™s both copyrighted and trademarked (please reference the <a href="https://martbetz.github.io/terms-and-conditions.html#copyright">site T&Cs</a>)&nbsp;â€” <i>so donâ€™t go trying to kidnap him, Bob!</i>Â¹
