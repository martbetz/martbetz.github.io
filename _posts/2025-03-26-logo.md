For the past couple of months, I’ve been busy doing nothing; it comes as no surprise, then, that stuff’s been piling up. I did have time to get a logo done, though, and I'll get it added soon — <i>finally, you’ll get to meet Bob!</i>

<!-- <div>
  <center>
     <img style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 25px;" width="400px"  height="400px" src="" alt="Bob">
  </center>
</div> -->

While the current logo will stay, it was never meant as the main one; it’s actually the site’s favicon logo that’s been plugging a hole in the short term. Likewise, I’ll also be updating my avatar.

It took me a while to make up my mind, but I now have something I’m cool with. As soon as I’ve got the important things done (updates, backups, and some real-world stuff), I’ll get the site updated.

Update (Mar 27, 2025): Voilà! Job done! Meet Bob!
