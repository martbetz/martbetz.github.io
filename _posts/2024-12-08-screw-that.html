title: Screw That!
layout: post

<p>
Buying cheap tools is rarely a good idea, but several hundred quid for drivers? 😲 Surely there must be a middle ground? Well, as it turns out, there is&nbsp;— <i>but you really need to know what to look for and where you need to look to find it.</i> 
</p>

<p>
When choosing a watchmaker’s screwdriver set, quality is king; the only problem is, quality comes at a price&nbsp;— and the price of a quality set these days can just be plain darn crazy!
</p>

<p>
The good news is, quality drivers <i>do</i> exist at reasonable price points; the bad news is, they’re scarce; especially in a market saturated by cheap and nasty rubbish. 
</p>

<p>
So how do you sort the wheat from the chaff? Well, have a read of this: <a href="https://wahawatches.com/best-watchmaker-screwdrivers-for-beginners/">Best Watchmaker Screwdrivers for Beginners</a> by Melvin Hollenburg (wahawatches.com).

Thank’s to Melvin’s advice, I was able to narrow things down. Two close contenders were a nine-piece set by <a href="https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/cousins-swiss-style-sets-rotating-stands#">Cousins UK (S57442)</a> and a five-piece set by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/KD89-Watchmakers-Screwdrivers-Chrome-Plated-0-60-0-80-1-00-1-2-1-4/dp/B0C945P8D1">KD89 Horotec (MSA01.095)</a>,¹ but I finally settled on a seven-piece set by <a href="https://www.beco-technic.com/en/7-screwdrivers-0-6-2-0-mm-blastic-box-with-spare-blades/205941">Beco Technic (205941)</a>.

They’re winging it in from Germany as we speak, and all for the price of £35 (including postage and packing)&nbsp;— <i>so be sure to check back for an update, Bob!</i>

  ¹ I’ve listed these particular ones as per the seller’s description, though I highly doubt that Horotec has much at all to do with them (as far as I’m aware, none of their stuff’s made in France). Even so, they could still be a sensible option.

Update (Dec 13, 2024): Hold the fort! The delivery turned up today, and I’m really disappointed&nbsp;— as soon as I opened the package, I could tell that something was wrong.&nbsp;🤨
</p>

<p>
Although there were no signs of damage, the drivers looked awkwardly placed; then, when I peeled off the heat-wrap, the lid of the box just sprang open!&nbsp;😣

    <font size="4">
      <b><i> Hello, 
        <span style="font-weight:700; color: #6A6A6A">SOLID STONE FLOOR!</span>

The drivers don’t fit in their case; it’s plainly as simple as that&nbsp;— would a brand like Beco Technics <i>really</i> miss something like this, or have we a swap-out for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/">knock&#8209;offs</a>?&nbsp;🤔
</p>

<p>
I don’t have imperforate faith in these, so I’ll simply have to return them. I may well try the Cousins set&nbsp;— these ones come with a nice little stand, <i>and</i> they work out a bit cheaper.
