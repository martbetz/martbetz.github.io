Over at the PIXLS.US forum, there's a particularly interesting thread; several fellow enthusiasts have shared their various solutions for analogue to digital conversion — <i>it's a really good read, and the posts are still coming!</i>

There are nine illustrated examples on the [the thread](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/diy-copy-stand-for-dslr-scanning/14833/71) so far (with the latest being added today), so it started me thinking: maybe we could post these solutions, each with a step-by-step guide, to a dedicated GitHub repo? 

And so my mission begins — <i>watch this space!</i>
