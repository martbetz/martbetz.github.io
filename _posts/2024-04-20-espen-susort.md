I normally find new websites through forum posts and reference notes, but I'll sometimes come across them by pure and utter chance. Today, while searching for some info on lenses, up popped Espen's photography blog. 🏆

Described as ‘a photo blog about rare, unusual, and vintage lenses,’ the website’s a labour of love; this much is obvious, from the attention-grabbing details of the visuals to the informative and well written content. 

Head on over to [espensusort.no](espensusort.no) right now and check it out — and, as a bonus, you’ll find some really neat stuff in the Resources section!
