The problem I find with hiking apps is they tend to be a bit snoopy, most require sign-up and like to chew on data, and a lots of them are pay-walled or ship with a cart load of ads. There are a few exceptions, though.

In contrast to using Google Maps, <a href="https://organicmaps.app/ ">Organic Maps</a> works offline (for free). To help keep track of progress, there’s a nice simple app called <a href="https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack">FitoTrack</a>. I’ve decided to try out both, and I’ll be posting my experience very shortly.

Update (Mar 12,2025): My first attempt with FitoTrack didn’t go so well; it tracked me for all of ten minutes, but then it decided to stop. I think I may know what went wrong, though, so I’ll give it another try soon.
