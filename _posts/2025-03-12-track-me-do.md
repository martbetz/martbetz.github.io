The problem I find with hiking apps is they tend to be a bit snoopy, most require sign-up and like to chew on data, and a lots of them are pay-walled or ship with a cart load of ads. There are a few exceptions, though.

<a href="https://organicmaps.app/ ">Organic Maps</a> is a popular sub for Google maps; after reading <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/organic-maps-google-maps-privacy-focused-alternative/">Digvijay Kumarâ€™s post</a>, I certainly see the appeal. To help keep track of progress, thereâ€™s a nice simple app called <a href="https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack">FitoTrack</a>. Iâ€™ve decided to try out both, and Iâ€™ll be posting my experience very shortly.

Update (Mar 13, 2025): My first attempt with FitoTrack didnâ€™t go so well; it tracked me for all of ten minutes, but then it decided to stop. I think I may know what went wrong, though, so Iâ€™ll give it another try soon.

Update (Mar 16, 2025): Yey! I got it to work! I walked around six miles, today, and it all got recorded seamlessly in both FitoTrack <i>and</i> Organic Maps. I have an old Samsung phone at home, and... Mmm... I wonder... ðŸ¤”
