The problem I find with hiking apps is they tend to be a bit snoopy, most require sign-up and like to chew on data, and lots of them are pay-walled or ship with a cart load of ads. There are a few exceptions, though.

<style>
.center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 600px;
}
</style>

<!-- <div>
     <img style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 25px;" class="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martbetz/martbetz.github.io/refs/heads/main/_includes/custom/phone-hiker.jpg" alt="Hiker">
</div> -->

<a href="https://organicmaps.app/ ">Organic Maps</a> is a popular sub for Google maps; after reading <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/organic-maps-google-maps-privacy-focused-alternative/">Digvijay Kumarâ€™s post</a>, I certainly see the appeal. I also found a nice simple app called <a href="https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack">FitoTrack</a> to help keep a log of progress, and another app called <a href="https://kylecorry.com/Trail-Sense/">Trail Sense</a> thatâ€™s very cool indeed.

While Iâ€™ve always got my smartphone to hand, I wanted to try something different; I wanted a seperate device for when Iâ€™m out walking and hiking for the following three main reasons:

<ul>
<li>it preserves the battery life of my main phone</li>
<li>it means I can keep my main phone safely tucked away</li>
<li>it offers peace of mind â€” I can always fall back on my main phone should anything ever go wrong</li>
</ul>

As luck would have it, I still had an old <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S6">S6</a> in the draw; this fit the bill just perfect as theyâ€™re nice and small, have good displays, and can still run the apps without issue (as a bonus, this one even came with a nice protective cover). 

The only slight downside in my case is the battery on this thing is shot, but thatâ€™s nothing an external pack canâ€™t solve (I considered replacing the battery, but the payoffâ€™s just not worth the cost).

With all the apps installed, I took it for a three-hour  test walk; it all worked perfectly (everything runs off GPS; thereâ€™s no SIM installed, and the wi-fi's turned off to save juice). 

So there we have it; altogether, a rather simple solution that's both cost-effective and eco-friendly (even if I say so myself ðŸ˜Ž).
