Why don't action cameras come with lens caps? It's absolutely crazy! I <i>would</i> say it's like buying a pair of shoes without laces, but even <i>that</i> would be an unfair analogy — <i>at least they're cheap, easy to find, and easy to get hold of!</i>¹

If you're lucky enough to own a 3D printer, you could always print your own;² I'm not, so I made one out of a bottle top (it didn't cost me a penny, _and_ I saved the life of a seagull 😇).

While I'm on the subject, it's great to see that Simon Forster's added some nice M42 rear caps to his selection. I think I might get me some.

<p>UPDATE (08.07.2023): I've also made some button protectors from the feet of an old <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Logitech-Optical-Mouse-B100-810-003656/dp/B07KY3KJKH">Logitech mouse</a> — <i>they happened to fit perfectly, and now I can use the waterproof housing without getting the device all scratched up!</i> 🏆</p>

¹ Not <i>all</i> shoes <i>need</i> laces, of course, but those aren't the kind I'm refering to here — so stop trying to ruin my day. 😉
