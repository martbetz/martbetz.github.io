Why don't action cameras come with lens caps? It's absolutely crazy! I <i>would</i> say it's like buying a pair of shoes without laces, but even <i>that</i> would be an unfair analogy;¹ at least laces cheap, easy to find, and easy to get hold of!

If you're lucky enough to own a 3D printer, you could always print your own;² I'm not, so I made one out of a bottle top — it didn't cost me a penny, _and_ I saved the life of a seagull. 😇

While I'm on the subject, it's great to see that Simon Forster's added some nice M42 rear caps to his selection. I think I might get me some.

¹ Not <i>all</i> shoes <i>need</i> laces, of course, but those aren't the kind I'm refering to here — so stop trying to ruin my day. 😉
