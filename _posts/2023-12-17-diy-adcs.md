Over at PIXLS.US, there's a really interesting thread; several talented members have shared their creative  solutions for analogue to digital conversion. With nine examples so far (the latest was added today), it’s well worth taking a look.

All this quality content got me thinking: why not start a GitHub repo and turn these posts into projects? I've added my thoughts to [the discourse](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/diy-copy-stand-for-dslr-scanning/14833/71), and I'll wait to see what happens. If there’s an interest, I may even post up an article.
