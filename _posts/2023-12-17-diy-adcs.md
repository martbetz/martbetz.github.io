All this quality content got me thinking: why not start a GitHub repo and turn these posts into projects? I've added my thoughts to [the discourse](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/diy-copy-stand-for-dslr-scanning/14833/71), and I'll wait to see what happens. If there’s an interest, I may even post up an article.
