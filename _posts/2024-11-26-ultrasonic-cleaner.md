Itâ€™s not very often that I buy stuff on a whim, but even frugally-yours falls victim to a deal just once in a while. Iâ€™ve just got back from a local store with my latest toy in tow: a 50W, 500ml ultrasonic cleaner â€” <i>and, so far, Iâ€™m pretty impressed!</i>

Iâ€™ve wanted an ultrasonic cleaner for quite some time, but Iâ€™ve always been somewhat skeptical; are they <i>really</i> any good? It wasnâ€™t until I discovered Marshallâ€™s <a href="https://m.youtube.com/c/WristwatchRevival ">Wristwatch Revival</a> channel on YouTube that I thought Iâ€™d give one a try, and a store not far away from me had some for twenty quid (and I also needed some excersise, so my stars had truely aligned&nbsp;ðŸ˜‰).

I very nearly missed out as all bar one had gone, and the only one remaining was looking a little abused (the box had been carelessly opened, everything taken out, then hastenly shoved back in). Against my better judgement, though, I took it down to the till.

I got it back home and checked it, and everything seemed to be fine; none of the parts were missing, and nothing too battered or bruised. I filled it up, popped in some bits, and switched it on; everything worked like a charm. ðŸ˜Š 

I wasnâ€™t expecting miracles from a basic unit like this, but it left me most pleasantly surprised â€” <i>it really did get stuff clean!</i> Maybe I'll upgrade in the future, but this new little gadget is most definately a welcome addition to my workbench.
