boggys.co.uk is no more — the site was host to a plethora of user manuals and repair guides for numerous vintage Kiron lenses (amongst many other wonderful things), all made freely available as a curated public resource. 

I've never spoken with boggy; I always meant to reach out, if only to say 'thank you' for all the hard work and generosity, but — much to my shameful regret — I never got around it (and I make no excuses for my shear lack of oversight).

When a website like this one goes bye-bye, it's never good news; mountains of irreplaceable information can instantly blink out of existence — _hopelessly lost forever; never to be seen again_ — and I definitely feared the worst!

Fortunately — _and with great relief!_ — I tracked boggy down to [KironKlub](https://groups.io/g/KironKlub), and it seems that all the amazing work is still in high gear! If they'll have me, I'll definitely be signing up very soon — and I'll be able to say 'hello' at long last! 😊
