boggys.co.uk is sadly no more; the site was host to a plethora of user manuals and repair guides for numerous vintage Kiron lenses&nbsp;— _amongst a great many other such wonderful things!_&nbsp;— all made readily available as a curated public resource. 

<!--I've never spoken with boggy; I always meant to reach out, if only to say 'thank you' for all the hard work and generosity, but&nbsp;— much to my shameful regret&nbsp;— I never got around it (and I make no excuses for my shear lack of oversight).-->

When a website like this one goes bye-bye, it's never good news; mountains of irreplaceable information can instantly blink out of existence&nbsp;— _hopelessly lost forever; never to be seen again_&nbsp;— and I most certainly feared the worst!

Fortunately&nbsp;— <i>and with great relief!</i>&nbsp;— I tracked boggy down to <a href="https://groups.io/g/KironKlub" >KironKlub</a> where all the amazing work is still in high gear (and while you'll now need to register to access all the goodies, membership is both free and open to everyone). 🍻
