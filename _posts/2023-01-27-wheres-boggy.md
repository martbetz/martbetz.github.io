boggys.co.uk is no more — the site was host to a plethora of vintage lens manuals (amongst many other wonderful things), all made freely available as a curated public resource — but fear not; everything's still available at Kiron Klub! 

When a website like this one goes bye-bye, it's never good news; mountains of irreplaceable information can instantly blink out of existence — _hopelessly lost forever; never to be seen again_ — and I definitely feared the worst!
