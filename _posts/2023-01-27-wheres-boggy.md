boggys.co.uk is no more â€” the site was host to a plethora of user manuals and repair guides for numerous vintage Kiron lenses (amongst many other wonderful things), all made readily available as a curated public resource. 

<!--I've never spoken with boggy; I always meant to reach out, if only to say 'thank you' for all the hard work and generosity, but â€” much to my shameful regret â€” I never got around it (and I make no excuses for my shear lack of oversight).-->

When a website like this one goes bye-bye, it's never good news; mountains of irreplaceable information can instantly blink out of existence â€” _hopelessly lost forever; never to be seen again_ â€” and I most certainly feared the worst!

Fortunately â€” _and with great relief!_ â€” I tracked boggy down to [KironKlub](https://groups.io/g/KironKlub) where all the amazing work is still in high gear (and while you'll now need to register to access all the goodies, membership is both free and open to everyone)! ðŸ˜Š
