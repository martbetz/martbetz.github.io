boggys.co.uk is sadly no more, and the loss is nothing short of catastrophic — the site was host to a plethora of vintage lens manuals (amongst many other wonderful things), all made freely available as a curated public resource.

When things like this happen, it makes my heart bleed — mountains of irreplaceable information just suddenly blinks out of existence and is hoplessly lost forever.
