As soon as I heard RawTherapee 5.9-rc1 was available, I couldn't wait to give it a test run! It's been quite some time since the official 5.8  stable release&nbsp;â€” _almost three years, in fact!_&nbsp;â€” but the wait has most definately been worth it!

### What's new? ###

The latest [RawTherapee 5.9 project update](https://www.rawtherapee.com/2022/07/rawtherapee-5.9-wip-and-project-updates/) lists _a lot_ of major upgrades and additions: local adjustments, abstract profiles, waveform and vectorscope, camera-based perspective correction, full-screen/detached inspector, spot removal, colour-correlation white balance, dual-demosaic with bilenear, improved film-negative, and improved wavelets! 

### Any issues? ###

As far as general usage goes, everything works perfectly (so much so that I've already made the switch, though I'll be sticking with the AppImage for now). Having said this, I _did_ experience a problem when using my 5.8 processing profiles&nbsp;â€” _something somewhere was waaaaay out of wack!_&nbsp;â€” but my personal incompetent buffoonary was mostly to blame for that.Â¹ ðŸ˜¬



### When will the official release be available? ###

<s>Anytime now, according to the <a href="https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/issues/5632">RawTherapee 5.9 roadmap</a> (the <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/rawtherapee/14">RawTherapee discussion forum</a> is also debating the release date via an open public thread). In the meantime, why not download <a href="https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/releases">Rawtherapee 5.9-rc1</a> for yourself and give it a whirl?</s> 
<br>
The official release of [RawTherapee 5.9](http://rawtherapee.com) has just been made available. Binaries for Windows and Linux are complete and ready for download, with a macOS binary to follow very shortly; alternatively, you can [build Rawtherapee 5.9](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/rawtherapee-5-9-released/33834/34?) directly from source.
