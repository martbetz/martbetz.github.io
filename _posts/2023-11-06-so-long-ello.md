Well, paint me orange and call me Donald! I went to sign in around lunch time, but the website's just no longer there! So what gives? Will it be back? Where's all my suff? Ello has left the building â€” _and without so much as a dicky bird!_ ðŸ˜² 

<h3>Who's doing what, now?</h3>

As I understand it, here's the order of chaos:

- 22 June â€“ service goes offline without notice
- 04 July â€“ service is resumed without comment
- 27 July â€“ service goes offline without notice

So that's most definately that, then, or so it apparently seems: [try to access the website](https://www.ello.co); be dealt the digit of doom!Â¹

<h3>What Next?</h3>

For a great many users of Ello, here was [a lesson hard learned](https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comment-34580). I planned to host all of my shots there, along with some digital art (having not used it for ages, it sort of made practical sense). Speaking with blessings of hindsight, I was saved by my bone-idle butt; had I been otherwise minded...

Ah, well... 

So long, [Ello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ello_(social_network)), and thanks for all the fish (among other things).
