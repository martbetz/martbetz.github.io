Well, paint me orange and call me Donald! I went to sign in around lunch time, but the website is no longer there! What gives? Will it be back? Where's all my suff? Ello has left the building, folks â€” _and without so much as a dicky!_ ðŸ˜² 

<h3>Who's doing what, now?</h3>

As I understand it, here's the order of chaos:

- 18 June â€“ service goes offline without notice
- 04 July â€“ service is resumed without comment
- 27 July â€“ service goes offline without notice

So that's most certainly that, then, or so it apparently seems&nbsp;â€” _if you [try to access the website](https://www.ello.co), you'll be served the middle digit!_ Â¹

<h3>What Next?</h3>

Sadly, for a great many users of Ello, here lies [a lesson hard learned](https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comment-34580). I&nbsp;was going to host all my shots there, along with my digital art (I already had an account, so it somewhat made practical sense). Speaking with blessings of hindsight, I was saved by my bone-idle butt; had I been otherwise inclined... ðŸ˜¬

Ah, well... 

So long, [Ello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ello_(social_network)), and thanks for all the fish (as well as all the other outlandish and wonderful things).
