Well, paint me orange and call me Donald; I went to sign in around lunch time, but the website's just no longer there! What gives? Will it be back? Where's all me suff? Ello has left the building â€” _and without so much as a dicky!_&nbsp;ðŸ˜²

<h3>Who's doing what, now?</h3>

As I understand it, here's the order of chaos:

- 18 June â€“ service goes offline without notice
- 04 July â€“ service is resumed without comment
- 27 July â€“ service goes offline without notice

<!--So that's most certainly that, then, or so it apparently seems&nbsp;â€” _if&nbsp;you [try to access the website](https://www.ello.co), you'll be served the middle digit!_ Â¹-->

So thatâ€™s that, then, I suppose; ifÂ youÂ [try to access the website](https://www.ello.co) right now, youâ€™ll be served the middle digitÂ¹ (and with the cruel gift of hindsight, here lies [a lesson hard learned](https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comment-34580) â€” _thanks to my bone-idle butt, I was luckily spared all the mayhem_&nbsp;ðŸ˜¬).

<h3>What Next?</h3>

<!--Sadly, for a great many users of Ello, here lies [a lesson hard learned](https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comment-34580). I&nbsp;was going to host all my shots there, along side my digital art (I already had an account, so it somewhat made practical sense). Preaching with blessings of hindsight, I was saved by my bone-idle butt; had I been otherwise inclined... ðŸ˜¬-->

I planned on using Ello to host my photos and artwork (or anthing else of appeciative size I could then embed on this site); I already had an account that I never really used, so I thought it made practical sense. I also liked its simplicity.

Not to worry; Iâ€™m counting up my blessings and Iâ€™m blogging off [to the Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to) (most likely). So long, [Ello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ello_(social_network)), and thanks for all the fish (as well as all the other outlandishly random things; your tolence of creative lunacy will certainly be missed&nbsp;ðŸ˜ž).
