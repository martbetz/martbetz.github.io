Well, paint me orange and call me Donald; I went to sign in around lunch time, but the website's just no longer there! So what gives? Will it be back? Where's all my suff? Ello has left the building â€” _and without so much as a dicky bird!_ ðŸ˜² 

As I understand it, here's the order of chaos:

- 22 June â€“ service goes offline without notice
- 04 July â€“ service is resumed with no explanation of downtime
- 27 July â€“ service goes offline without notice

So that's most definately that, then, or so it apparently seems; [attempt to connect with Ello](https://www.ello.co), and be served a delightful mid digit.Â¹

For many, it's [a lesson hard learned](https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comment-34580). I planned to host all of my shots there, along with a few other things (having not used it for ages, it sort of made practical sense). Speaking with blessings of hindsight, I was saved by my bone-idle butt; had I been otherwise inclined..

Ah, well... 

So long, [Ello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ello_(social_network)), and thanks for all the fish.
