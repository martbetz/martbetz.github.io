When stored for a while without use, LiPos can wither and die; to avoid this, itâ€™s best maintain their storage charge at 40% - 60%&nbsp;â€” <i>but, sometimes... well... accidents happen.</i> ðŸ˜ž

When I tried to power the phone on, nothing was working at all; it semmed the battery had somehow bottomed out, so I plugged it into the charger and waited... and waited... and waited...

I left the charger plugged in, but the phone refused charge (the icon diplayed in the middle of the screen was stubbornly showing no progress, and a little red light in the corner of the grill just kept on flashing away).

Oh dear. 

<a href="https://www.grepow.com/faq/lipo-battery-storage-faqs.html">Storing LiPos correctly</a> is something Iâ€™ve taken to heart, but Iâ€™m far from being perfect; when I last messed around with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_One_(M8)">this little chap</a>, I forgot to do the needful. ðŸ˜³

Iâ€™ve just about tried everthing, now, so thereâ€™s only one thing for it: surgery (Iâ€™m hoping I can grab a battery thatâ€™s still in worthwhile shape).
