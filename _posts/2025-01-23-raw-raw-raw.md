“What does RAW really stand for?” It's a question I’m asked all the time. “Nothing” would be the short answer, which always gets followed by “Why?” Now, that <i>is</i> a good question; the answer to that one, though, is slightly more involved.

TIFF, GIF, AVIF... and, of course, JPEG. We’re all quite used to acronyms, those funny little nonsense names we like to give our file types. It seems a fair assumption, then, that RAW should be one too; after all, it certainly <i>looks</i> like it should. 

RAW, or ‘raw,’ as I choose to call it (you’re about to find out why) is a general collective term; it's the name we give to the data that’s caputured by digital cameras. 

All of the different camera brands do this in different ways: sometimes, the data's disgaurded and a JPEG’s produced instead; sometimes, the data’s retained and it’s stored as a neat little file (it all depends on the firmware and the options set up at the time). 

Those neat little files are called ‘raw files.’ Raw files have <i>many</i> different extensions; here are a few [examples](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/camera_raw):

- RAF (Fujifilm)
- CR2 (Canon)
- RW2 (Panasonic)
- NRW (Nikon)
- ARW (Sony)
- ORF (Olympus)
- MRW (Minolta)
- PEF (Pentax)

All of these are initialisms (some being better than others — <i>Fujifilm?!</i>), and all of them are raw files — hold that thought.

So, here are the takeaways so far:

1. ‘RAW data’ collectively refers to the data that’s capured by a digital camera
2. 'RAW file' collectively refers to a file that contains raw data
3. ‘RAW' is not a specific image format in and of itself
4. ‘RAW’ is neither an acronym nor an initialism

Now for the intetesting bit. 😁 Why, then, do we write it as ‘RAW?’ The short answer is that we shouldn’t; it should really be written as ‘raw.’ As far as the misconception goes, we’ve many contributing sources; here are a few of the main ones:

1. the misplaced trust of common practice
2. the misguided conclusion that it <i>should</i> be capitalised as <i>all</i> image formats are capitalised
3. the unjustified belief that 'RAW’ is a word that’s special somehow (and means something different to ‘raw’).

So there we have it; ‘RAW’ doesn't stand for anything — <i>so it should be written as ‘raw.’</i>&nbsp;😁 I’m off to anoy the ISO brigade, now, so I’ll catch you very soon! 😉
