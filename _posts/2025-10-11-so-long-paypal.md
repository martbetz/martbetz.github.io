title: So Long PayPal 
categories: computing

I tried to log into PayPal,  today, but something rather alarming happened&nbsp;— I could no longer prove I was me! For some concerning reason, authentication (which I hadn't set up) was required by SMS (to a number I stopped using ten years ago). Yikes!

My very first thought was a hacking attempt, but I'm now pretty sure that it isn't — I'll spare you the boring details, but quite a few things don't add up. If I had to lay some cash on the table, I'd say this was down to a cork up.

Truth be told, I've never been that comfortable with PayPal, but I 'needed' to use it for eBay; however, I've only just now realised this isn't the case any more — eBay now takes credit cards, so that's the end of that.

When I manage to get all this sorted, then, I'll be closing the whole lot down — and I'll have one less thing to worry about, one less thing to fuss over, and one less thing to get frustrated by as a very welcomed result.
