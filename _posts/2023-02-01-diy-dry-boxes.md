I ordered some plastic containers last week, but I slightly misjudged my requirements. ðŸ˜  Not to worry; instead of <s><i>nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow!</i></s> sending them back, Iâ€™ve decided to try something else.

Iâ€™ve been mulling on this project for a while, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap!) I'm finally going to tackle it. The plan is to make two different types of dry-box: a standard one for general storage, and a portable one for use with my rucksack.

I'll be sharing my progress periodically, and I'll escalate this post to the [projects](https://martbetz.github.io/archive.html#diy) list when I'm done (maybe it'll turn out as a shining demonstration of sucess, or maybe it'll end up as a dismal example of failure; we'll have to wait and see ðŸ˜¬). Now... where did I put that blowtorch?
