title: DIY Dry-Boxes

I bought a bunch of containers last week, but they didn't quite fit the purpose that I originally had in mind. Not to worry; instead of nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow, I've decided to turn them into dry-boxes.

Iâ€™ve been planning on a project like this for quite some time, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap) I'm ready to make a start.
