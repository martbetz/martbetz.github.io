title: DIY Dry-Boxes
format: post

I bought some plastic tubs from Hobbycraft last week, but I stupidly got all the measurements wrong. Not to worry; instead of nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow, I’ve decided to make them into dry-boxes.

I’ve been mulling on a project like this for some time, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap 😠) I'm finally going to tackle it. The plan is to make two different types of dry-box: a standard one for general storage, and a portable one for use with my rucksack.

I'll be sharing my progress periodically, and I'll escalate this post to the [projects](https://martbetz.github.io/archive.html#diy) list when I'm done (maybe it'll turn out as a shining demonstration of sucess, or maybe it'll end up as a dismal example of failure; we'll have to wait and see 😬). Now... where did I put that blowtorch?
