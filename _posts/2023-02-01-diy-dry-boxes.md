title: DIY Dry-Boxes
format: post
---

I bought a bunch of containers last week; they ended up being completely unsuitable for their originally intended purpose, so (instead of nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow!) I've decided to turn them into dry-boxes.

Iâ€™ve been planning on a project like this for quite some time, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap) I'm ready to make a start.
