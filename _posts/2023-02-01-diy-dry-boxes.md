I bought some plastic tubs from Hobbycraft last week, but they weren't quite right for what I had in mind; be that as it may â€” _instead of nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow!_ â€” Iâ€™ve decided to turn them into dry-boxes.

### Sounds good. What's the plan? ###

Iâ€™ve been mulling on a project like this for some time, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap ðŸ˜ ) I'm finally going to tackle it. The plan is to make two different types of dry-box: a standard one for general storage, and a portable one for use with my rucksack.
