title: DIY Dry-Boxes
format: post

I bought some plastic tubs from Hobbycraft last week, but they weren't quite right for what I had in mind. Not to worry; instead of nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow, I’ve decided to turn them into dry-boxes.

### The Plan ###

I’ve been mulling on a project like this for some time, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap) I'm finally  tackle it. The plan is to make two different types of dry-box: a standard one for general storage, and portable one for use with my rucksack.
