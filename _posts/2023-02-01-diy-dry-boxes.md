title: DIY Dry-Boxes
format: post

I bought some plastic tubs from Hobbycraft last week, but they weren't quite right for what I had in mind. Not to worry; instead of nailing them to a Frizbee and flinging them over a rainbow, I’ve decided to turn them into dry-boxes.

I’ve been planning on a project like this for quite some time, and (thanks to the aforementioned mishap) I'm ready to make a start.
