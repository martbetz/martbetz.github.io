According to the RawTherapee roadmap, some of the features essential to my workflow may well be removed completely from version 6.0 onward. Should this be the case, where will I go from here, I wonder?

I'm faced with a very uncomfortable possibilty: 5.10 could very well be my final RawTherapee upgrade. Throwing away the tools I need just wouldn't be a viable option, and there's also a good chance that my custom PP3s may not be compatible either â€” _in short, upgrading to [RawTherapee 6.0](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/milestone/10) could mean starting completely from scratch without the tools to do it._ Â¹ ðŸ˜³

<!-- In an ideal world, things would be more flexible (think of the way plugins work in GIMP or addons work in Firefox); tools could be maintained independently, and the user would get to choose their own destiny. Unfortunately, though, this isn't practically possible; I'm merely affording myself the luxury of a brief flight of fantacy. -->

The good news is, should the worst case scenario unfold, there's always a workaround: over the shorter term, I'd be hoping for a 5.10 LTS branch; over the longer term, sticking with a 5.9/5.10 Appimage (run from a static distro in a virtual machine, if necessary) would likely be the way to go.Â²

Â¹ Having said all this, the discussion thread on Github has been open since 2019 (as you can see from the screen-shot above); as such, there's likely some way to go just yet.

Â² You never know; with the combined magic of Linux and FOSS, I might still be using it 20 years from now. ðŸ’¾
