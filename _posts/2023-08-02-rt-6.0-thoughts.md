According to the RawTherapee roadmap, some of the features essential to my workflow may well be removed completely from version 6.0 onward. Should this be the case, where will I go from here, I wonder?

Throwing away the tools I need just isn't a viable option, so I'm faced with an uncomfortable truth: there's a very good chance that 5.10 will be my final RawTherapee upgrade. If that wasn't bad enough, none of my custom PP3s will be compatible either. In short, upgrading to [RawTherapee 6.0](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/milestone/10) would mean starting completely from scratch without any of the tools to do it.¹ 😳

<!-- In an ideal world, things would be more flexible (think of the way plugins work in GIMP or addons work in Firefox); tools could be maintained independently, and the user would get to choose their own destiny. Unfortunately, though, this isn't practically possible; I'm merely affording myself the luxury of a brief flight of fantacy. -->

Over the shorter term, I'm hoping for a 5.10 LTS branch; over the longer term, sticking with a 5.9/5.10 Appimage (run from a static distro in a virtual machine, if necessary) is likely the way to go.²

¹ Having said all this, the discussion thread on Github's been open since 2019 (as you can see from the screen-shot above); there's likely some way to go just yet, so we'll see what the future _really_ holds when we get there.

² You never know; with the combined magic of Linux and FOSS, I might still be using it 20 years from now. 💾
