According to the [RawTherapee roadmap](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/milestone/10), some of the features essential to my workflow may well be removed completely from version 6.0 onward. Should this be the case, where would I go from here, I wonder?

Throwing away the tools I need just isn't a viable option, so I'm faced with an uncomfortable truth: there's a very good chance that 5.10 will be my final RawTherapee upgrade. If that wasn't bad enough, none of my custom PP3s will be compatible either. Upgrading to 6.0 would mean starting completely from scratch without the tools to do it. 

In an ideal world, things would be more flexible (think of the way plugins work in GIMP or addons work in Firefox); tools could be maintained independently, and the user would get to choose their own destiny. Unfortunately, though, this isn't practically possible; I'm merely affording myself the luxury of a brief flight of fantacy.

Over the shorter term, I'm hoping for a 5.10 LTS branch; over the longer term, sticking with a 5.9/5.10 Appimage is likely the way to go. You never know; with the combined magic of Linux and FOSS, I might still be using it 20 years from now.
