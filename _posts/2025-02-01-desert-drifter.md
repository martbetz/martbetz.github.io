I was greeted by further sad news, today, when checking in on Youtube; Andrew Cross was involved in a terrible accident on Friday, and heâ€™s currently in critical condition. My thoughtâ€™s are with Andrew and his family at this challenging time. ðŸ’™

Iâ€™ve been hooked on [Desert Drifter](https://m.youtube.com/@Desert.Drifter) for a while, now; itâ€™s one of the few engaging YouTube channels that I  make the time to frequent. [Evelynâ€™s touching post](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SxyVttN_vXc), today, was very hard to watch.

For updateâ€™s on Andrewâ€™s journey, please visit [Andrew & Evelyn's CaringBridge](https://www.caringbridge.org/site/5fcb666d-e0b8-11ef-abc2-a31fd9bc4383?from=%2Fsearch&fname=Andrew%20%26%20Evelyn) page; to make a donation, please visit [their page at GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-crosses-with-medical-expenses).
