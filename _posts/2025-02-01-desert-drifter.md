I was greeted by further sad news, today, when checking in on Youtube; Andrew Cross was involved in a terrible accident on Friday, and heâ€™s currently in critical condition. My thoughts are with Andrew and his family at this challenging time. ðŸ’š

Iâ€™ve been hooked on [Desert Drifter](https://m.youtube.com/@Desert.Drifter) for a while, now; itâ€™s one of the few engaging YouTube channels that I  make the time to frequent. [Evelynâ€™s touching post](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SxyVttN_vXc) was very hard to watch.

For updates on Andrewâ€™s journey, please visit [Andrew & Evelyn's CaringBridge page](https://www.caringbridge.org/site/5fcb666d-e0b8-11ef-abc2-a31fd9bc4383?from=%2Fsearch&fname=Andrew%20%26%20Evelyn).

Update (Mar 4, 2025): Itâ€™s with great remorse that I share the sad news of Andrewâ€™s passing. Such a tragic loss. Thank you, Andrew, for the absolute joy that was Desert Drifter.
