<p>I created this ‘now’ page after stumbling upon Derik Sivers’ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a> (I kind of like the concept).
</p>

<span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
  <p style="color: grey">
    <font size="4"><b><i>When I was younger and thinner, I wanted to be older and wiser; now that I’m older and wiser, I want to be younger and thinner.</i></b></font>
  </p>
</span>

I'll try to keep this page updated — this is the whole point of a ‘now’ page, after all! — but I’m not going to make any promises.

Unfortunately, at least as far as shooting is concerned, I’m not up to much at the moment; due to a perfect storm of health issues (both physical and mental) and constantly poor weather for the time of year (rain, rain, and yet more rain!), I haven’t been able to get out and about.

I did manage to attend the Pride Cymru parade in Cardiff, though, dispite not being well enough to go to the main event (maybe next year); as you can see from the photo below, it’s very popular with fellow enthusiasts.

Not too worry; if my health and the weather improves, I’m sure I’ll be roaming the streets again before the season’s out.

<!-- I don’t shoot much over the winter&nbsp;— <i>that’s what the summer’s for!</i>&nbsp;— so away goes the flash gun, and out comes the keyboard.

Right now, I’m busy playing about with this website (as soon as I’m finished with all the basic stuff, I’ll be making a start on the content). 

UPDATE: I’m almost done! <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/new-website-soon-and-a-call-for-contributors/33998/35?u=martbetz">I’m now writing up a short article</a> for <a href="https://pixls.us">pixls.us</a>, and I’ll be sure to throw up a link once it’s published. -->
