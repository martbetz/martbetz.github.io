I created this 'now' page after stumbling upon Derik Sivers' <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a> (I kind of like the concept).
<br><br>
I don't shoot much over the winter — <i>that's what the summer's for!</i> — so away goes the flash gun, and out comes the keyboard.
<br><br>
Right now, I'm busy playing about with this website (as soon as I'm finished with all the basic stuff, I'll be making a start on the content). 
<br><br>
UPDATE: I'm almost done! <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/new-website-soon-and-a-call-for-contributors/33998/35?u=martbetz">I'm now writing up a short article</a> for <a href="https://pixls.us">pixls.us</a> — I'll be sure to throw up a link once it's published.
