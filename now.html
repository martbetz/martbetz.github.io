<p>I created this ‘now(ish)’ page after stumbling upon Derik Sivers’ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a> (I kind of like the concept).
</p>

<span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">

    <font size="4"><b><i>When I was younger, I wanted to be older and wiser; now that I’m older and wiser, I want to be younger and thinner.</i></b></font>

</span>

<p>
I'll try to keep this page updated, but (hence the intentionally conservative title) I'm not making any promises. 😴

Unfortunately, at least as far as shooting is concerned, I’m not up to much at the moment; due to a perfect storm of health issues (both physical and mental) and constantly poor weather for the time of year (rain, rain, and yet more rain!), I haven’t been able to get out and about.
</p>
 
<p>
I did manage to attend the Pride Cymru parade in Cardiff, though, dispite not being well enough to go to the main event (maybe next year); as you can see from the photo below, it’s very popular with fellow enthusiasts.

Not too worry; if my health — <i>and the weather!</i> — improves, I’m sure I’ll be roaming the streets again before the season’s out.

<b>I'm hoping to pop along to the <a href="https://www.wmc.org.uk/en/whats-on/2023/butetown-carnival-2023">Butetown Carnival</a> tomorrow. Just got myself organised. Lets hope the weather holds out!</b>

Well, it's (almost) that time of the year again. I don’t shoot much over the winter&nbsp;— <i>that’s what the summer’s for!</i>&nbsp;— so away goes the snapper and flash gun, and out comes the keyboard and toolbox.
<br><br>
I'm busy playing about with this website again, and I'll be devoting more time to servicing and repairing some gear ready for next season; I'm also getting myself better organised for 2024 (having learned my lesson from a rather chaotic 2023).

I don't shoot much over the winter, so away goes the snapper and out comes the botton box. I'm currently turning some thoughts into print, so I'll hopfully be posting a fair bit over the next few months.
</p>
<p>
2023 wasn't a productive year for me, and (unfavourable weather aside) this was entirely down to poor organisation and lackluster commitment on my part. I'm working on changing all that by preparing myself properly for next year (after all, you never know which ‘next year’ will be the one that never comes).
