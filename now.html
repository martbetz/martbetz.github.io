I created this ‘now’ page after stumbling upon Derik Sivers’ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a> (I kind of like the concept).
<br><br>
Unfortunately, at least as far as shooting is concerned, I'm not up to much at the moment; due to a perfect storm of health issues (both physical and mental) and constantly poor weather for the time of year (rain, rain, and yet more rain!), I haven't been able to get out and about.<br><br>
I did manage to attend the Pride Cwmru parade in Cardiff, though, dispite not being well enough to go to the main event (maybe next year); as you can see from the photo below, it's very popular with fellow entusiasts.<br><br>

Not too worry; if my health and the weather improves, I'm sure I'll be roaming the streets again before the season's out. <br><br>
<!-- I don’t shoot much over the winter&nbsp;— <i>that’s what the summer’s for!</i>&nbsp;— so away goes the flash gun, and out comes the keyboard.
<br><br>
Right now, I’m busy playing about with this website (as soon as I’m finished with all the basic stuff, I’ll be making a start on the content). 
<br><br>
UPDATE: I’m almost done! <a href="https://discuss.pixls.us/t/new-website-soon-and-a-call-for-contributors/33998/35?u=martbetz">I’m now writing up a short article</a> for <a href="https://pixls.us">pixls.us</a>, and I’ll be sure to throw up a link once it’s published. -->
