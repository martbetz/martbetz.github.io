Unfortunately, at least as far as shooting is concerned, I’m not up to much at the moment; due to a perfect storm of health issues (both physical and mental) and constantly poor weather for the time of year (rain, rain, and yet more rain!), I haven’t been able to get out and about.
</p>
 
<p>
I did manage to attend the Pride Cymru parade in Cardiff, though, dispite not being well enough to go to the main event (maybe next year); as you can see from the photo below, it’s very popular with fellow enthusiasts.

Not too worry; if my health — <i>and the weather!</i> — improves, I’m sure I’ll be roaming the streets again before the season’s out.

<b>I'm hoping to pop along to the <a href="https://www.wmc.org.uk/en/whats-on/2023/butetown-carnival-2023">Butetown Carnival</a> tomorrow. Just got myself organised. Lets hope the weather holds out!</b>

Well, it's (almost) that time of the year again. I don’t shoot much over the winter&nbsp;— <i>that’s what the summer’s for!</i>&nbsp;— so away goes the snapper and flash gun, and out comes the keyboard and toolbox.
<br><br>
I'm busy playing about with this website again, and I'll be devoting more time to servicing and repairing some gear ready for next season; I'm also getting myself better organised for 2024 (having learned my lesson from a rather chaotic 2023).

 I told you I wouldn’t make any promises. 😉 I’m ever so sorry, but life just got in the way — <i>busy, busy, busy!</i> Photography wise, 2024 wasn’t as productive as I’d hoped; I’m determined to make up for it in 2025, though. I’m still keeping up with rambling, however, and the effort is definately paying dividends. 👊

As in turns out, getting stuff published on the main RawTherapee website is a bit of complex process, so I've decided to start a new project called <a href="https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawtherapist.html">RawTherapist</a>. Go check it out, and tell me what you think.&nbsp;😊

 I've been a little under the weather these past few days; my doctor likes to call it ‘irritable bowel syndrome,’ but something like ‘tooth-ache ring’ would be more accurate. 😖 I've a ramble planned for tomorrow, if I can manage more than an hour without thundering my shorts off; I best go off road, I think.&nbsp;😬
 </p>

<p>
On a brighter note, we've been chatting away on the PIXLS.US forum about the various ways of promoting the RawTherapee project; to cut a long story short, I'll be starting the ball rolling very shortly by writing up a press release for the up-and-coming 5.10 stable — <i>so watch this space!</i>&nbsp;😎

So far, so good! As far as the hiking goes, I’m off to a decent start (apart from almost plunging to my death the other day, but that’s a story for another time 😬).

I don’t shoot much over the winter, so away goes the snapper and out comes the clacker. I’m currently turning some thoughts into print, so I’ll hopfully be posting a fair bit over the next few months (I may even get an article or two finished for PIXLS.US).
</p>

<p>
I’ve not been very productive this year, and (unfavourable weather aside) that’s all been down to poor organisation and lackluster commitment on my part. I’m working on changing all that by <a href="https://martbetz.github.io/general/photography/2024/01/01/photo-fit.html"> preparing myself</a> properly for next year (after all, you never know which ‘next year’ will end up being the last).
