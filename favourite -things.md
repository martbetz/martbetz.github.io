I was going to create a  â€˜name and shameâ€™ page, here, but Iâ€™d still be hard at it when the stars burned out; this being the case, Iâ€™ve decided to do the opposite. Enjoy!

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>

[Hobbycraft](https://hobbycraft.co.uk) have never let me down, here; ordering is hastle free, delivery has always been well priced and lightning fast, and their packaging is second to none.

In general, the best storage containers I've found are made by [Really Useful Products](https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk) â€” theyâ€™re moulded from polypropylene, theyâ€™re translucent (but semi-translusent versions are also available), theyâ€™re roomy (without being excessively bulky), theyâ€™re very sturdy and well made, they have a nice rectangular interior, they're relatively inexpensive, and they're available in a huge variety of sizes.

<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven't found a more reliable supplier than [Kenable](https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/); from experience, I honestly can't recommend them enough.
