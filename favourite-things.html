      This webpage is currently under construction. I was going to create a ‘name and shame’ page, here, but I’d still be hard at it when the stars burn out; that being the case, I’ve instead decided to share some of my better experiences. 😊

   <p style="color: grey"> <font size="4"><b><i>
      Linux on smartphones and tablets and desktops, bright shiny lenses with really low <i>ƒ-</i>stops, custom-made keyboards with smooth thocky springs: these are a few of my favourite things! </i></font></b>
   </p>

<p>
   <font size="4"> 
      I’ve been told I’m hard to please, but I’d have to argue to the contrary; all I ask for is good value — <i>I expect what I was promised, on time, every time, and at the right price (and not to be taken for an idiot by excepting anything less).</i>

<h2>Grip-Seal Poly Bags</h2>
<p>
These are an absolute necessity; nothing that’s anywhere near as cost effective will keep your gear organised, free from dust and dirt, and protected against moisture (or even a downright drenching) — <i>Get some, and get them now!</i>
</p>

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>
<p>

Good quality storage boxes are truly indespensible, especially when it comes to keeping your gear safe and dry; polypropylene boxes are particularly handy because they’re also suitable for storing documents and prints. 
<p>
<a href="https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk">Really Useful Products</a>, for example, offer an impressive range of solutions; all of their boxes are very well made, relatively inexpensive, stackable, and have a nice rectangular interior (they’re also available in many different sizes and a choice of several colours). I ordered mine from <a href="https//hobbycraft.co.uk">Hobbycraft</a>; checkout was hastle free, delivery was lightning fast, and the packaging was second to none.

<h2>Power Banks</h2>
<p>
Batteries will always need charging, so a power bank’s simply a must – <i> but with so many options to pick from, take time to consider your needs!</i> 
</p>
I currently use the <a href="https://www.vrurcpower.com/products/vrurc-small-20000mah-pd-qc-fast-charging-power-bank">Vurac 20,000 mAh power bank</a> (I chose to go with the white one, but there’s also a version in black); when paired with a USB charger, I can ready a spare on the go.¹
   
<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven’t found a more reliable supplier than <a href="https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/">Kenable</a>; from experience, I honestly can’t recommend them enough.

<h2>LSE Transfer Tape</h2>
<p>
When it comes to repairing and refurbishing gear, I really couldn’t live without this stuff; when working with <a href="https://martbetz.github.io/hse-and-lse-polymers.html">low surface-energy materials</a>, it’s an absolute must — <i>it’s a far better solution than liquid adhesives for so many reasons!</i></p><p>I tend to use <a href="https://technicaldatasheets.3m.com/en_US?pif=000044?locale=en-US">300LSE by M3</a>; it’s far from cheap and it’s difficult to get hold of, but it’s certainly one of the best options out there.
</p>

<h2>Wrist Watches</h2>
<p>

It’s hard to “<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C6%91/8_and_be_there"><i>ƒ/</i>8 and be there</a>” if you don’t even know what time it is! Both my snapper and my phone have a perfectly good clock, so I haven’t worn a wrist watch for quite a few years; recently, though, I’ve started to use them again.
</br></br>
Here’s the thing: my phone’s tucked away from theiving little hands, and the clock on my snapper distracts me; all it takes now is a hassle-free glance — <i>and I don’t need to charge the battery every hour!</i>
</br></br>
My current go-to beater is a <a href="https://www.casio.co.uk/ae-1500wh-2avef">Casio AE-1500</a>; it’s inexpensive, reliable, well made, and has a large clear display that I can easily read in bright sunlight.

</p>

<h2>Water Shoes</h2>

<p>
   Apart from wet weather, nothing ruins my day like sore feet; reliable footware is an absolute must (especially when you’re out and about with a camera), and water shoes are a great (if somewhat unconvential) option. 
</p>

The best I’ve found so far are <a href="https://www.hot-tuna.com/searchresults?descriptionfilter=water%20shoes">Hot Tuna Aqua Shoes</a>; they’re well made, comfortable, and comparatively well priced. I ordered mine from <a href="https://sportsdirect.com">Sports Direct</a> (I snagged two pairs for under £20, which also included postage), and I honestly couldn’t fault them for their speedy delivery.

<h2>Boonie Hats</h2>
<p>
Boonie hats are a god send; they may seem unflattering to some<!-- (the Aussies call them <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boonie_hat#Australian_Army_giggle_hat">giggle hats</a>)-->, but&nbsp;— <i>unlike that melted nose on your face, there, Bob!</i>&nbsp;— at least you can take them off when the sun goes down. Just about every military force in the world provides them as standard issue (and for very good reason).
</p>
My favourite one to date is the <a href="https://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk/products/jaxon-james-packable-cotton-boonie-hat-khaki?_pos=5&_sid=d420f47ee&_ss=r"> Jaxon & James boonie</a> (it’s a little less Rambo and a little more Lara Croft), and it’s saved my skin&nbsp;— <i>quite literally!</i> — on countless occasions. I ordered mine from <a href="https://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk">Village Hats</a>, but lots of different places tend to stock them (the putty version is particularly nice).

<h2>Earplugs</h2>
<p>
I always carry earplugs; your hearing is important, and you never know when you’ll find yourself in a noisy situation (I once got very drunk at a nightclub and passed out next to a loudspeaker; I damaged my hearing permanently, and the frequent bouts of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus">tinnitus</a> lasted several — <i> very miserable! — </i>years).
