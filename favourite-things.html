      This webpage is currently under construction. I was going to create a ‘name and shame’ page, here, but I’d still be hard at it when the stars burn out; that being the case, I've instead decided to share some of my better experiences.

      Linux on smartphones and tablets and desktops,<br>
Bright shiny lenses with really low f-stops,<br>
Custom-made keyboards with smooth thocky springs;<br>
These are a few of my fave geeky things! </i></font></b>

      I’m told I’m hard to please, but I’d have to argue on the contrary; all I ask for is good value — I expect what I ask for, on time, every time, and at the right price — and not to be taken for an idiot by excepting anything less.

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>
<p>
In general, the best storage containers I've found are made by <a href="https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk">Really Useful Products</a> — they’re moulded from polypropylene, they’re translucent (but semi-translusent versions are also available), they’re roomy (without being excessively bulky), they’re very sturdy and well made, they have a nice rectangular interior, they're relatively inexpensive, and they're available in a huge variety of sizes.
</p>
<a href="https://hobbycraft.co.uk">Hobbycraft</a> have never let me down, here; ordering is hastle free, delivery has always been well priced and lightning fast, and their packaging is second to none.

<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven't found a more reliable supplier than <a href="https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/">Kenable</a>; from experience, I honestly can't recommend them enough.


<h2>Water Shoes</h2>

<p>
   Apart from wet weather, nothing ruins the time I spend with my camera more than sore feet; reliable footware is an absolute must, and water shoes are a great (if somewhat unconvential) option. The best I've found so far are the <a herf="https://www.hot-tuna.com/searchresults?descriptionfilter=water%20shoes">Hot Tuna Aqua</a> range — they're well made, comfortable, and fit perfectly; they're also comparatively cheap.
</p>

I purchased mine from <a href="https://sportsdirect.com">Sports Direct</a> (I snagged two pairs for under £20, which also included postage), and I couldn't fault them for their speedy delivery and hassle-free order process.
