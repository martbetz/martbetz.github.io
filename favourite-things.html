I was going to create a ‘name and shame’ page, here, but I’d still be hard at it when the stars burned out; this being the case, I’ve decided to do the opposite. Enjoy!

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://hobbycraft.co.uk">Hobbycraft</a> have never let me down, here; ordering is hastle free, delivery has always been well priced and lightning fast, and their packaging is second to none.
</p>
In general, the best storage containers I've found are made by <a href="https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk">Really Useful Products</a> — they’re moulded from polypropylene, they’re translucent (but semi-translusent versions are also available), they’re roomy (without being excessively bulky), they’re very sturdy and well made, they have a nice rectangular interior, they're relatively inexpensive, and they're available in a huge variety of sizes.

    <font size="4"><b><i>Linux on smartphones and tablets and desktops,<br>
Bright shiny lenses with really low f-stops,<br>

These are a few of my fave geeky things!</i></font></b>

<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven't found a more reliable supplier than <a href="https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/">Kenable</a>; from experience, I honestly can't recommend them enough.
