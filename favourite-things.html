      This webpage is currently under construction. I was going to create a ‘name and shame’ page, here, but I’d still be hard at it when the stars burn out; that being the case, I've instead decided to share some of my better experiences.

      Linux on smartphones and tablets and desktops, bright shiny lenses with really low f-stops, custom-made keyboards with smooth thocky springs; these are a few of my favourite things! </i></font></b>

      I’m told I’m hard to please, but I’d have to argue on the contrary; all I ask for is good value — I expect to get what’s promised, on time, every time, and at the right price; I won't be taken for an idiot by excepting anything less.

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>
<p>
In general, the best storage containers I've found are made by <a href="https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk">Really Useful Products</a>; they’re moulded from polypropylene, translucent (though semi-translusent versions are also available), roomy (without being excessively bulky), very sturdy and well made, have a nice rectangular interior, relatively inexpensive, and are available in a huge variety of shapes and sizes.
</p>
<a href="https://hobbycraft.co.uk">Hobbycraft</a> have never let me down, here; ordering is hastle free, delivery has always been well priced and lightning fast, and their packaging is second to none.

<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven't found a more reliable supplier than <a href="https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/">Kenable</a>; from experience, I honestly can't recommend them enough.


<h2>Water Shoes</h2>

<p>
   Apart from wet weather, nothing ruins the time I spend with my camera more than sore feet; reliable footware is an absolute must, and water shoes are a great (if somewhat unconvential) option. The best I've found so far are <a href="https://www.hot-tuna.com/searchresults?descriptionfilter=water%20shoes">Hot Tuna Aqua Shoes</a>; they're well made, comfortable (they fit perfectly), and comparatively well priced.
</p>

I purchased mine from <a href="https://sportsdirect.com">Sports Direct</a> (I snagged two pairs for under £20, which also included postage), and I couldn't fault them for their speedy delivery and straight-foward ordering process.

<h2>Boonie Hats</h2>
<p>
Boonie hats are a god send; they may look a little rediculous, but&nbsp;— <i>unlike that melted nose on your face, there, Bob!</i>&nbsp;— at least I can take them off when the sun goes down. Just about every military force in the world provides them as standard issue, and for damned good reason.
</p>
My favourite so far is my <a href="https://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk/products/jaxon-james-packable-cotton-boonie-hat-khaki?_pos=5&_sid=d420f47ee&_ss=r">   Jaxon & James boonie</a> in kaki, and it's saved my skin&nbsp;— <i>quite literally!</i> — on countless occasions; it's also a little less Rambo and a little more Lara Croft (which is nice). I ordered mine from <a href="https://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk">Village Hats</a>, but quite a few different places tend to stock them.
