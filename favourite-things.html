      This webpage is currently under construction. I was going to create a ‘name and shame’ page, here, but I’d still be hard at it when the stars burn out; that being the case, I've decided on sharing some of my better experiences instead.

      Linux on smartphones and tablets and desktops,<br>
Bright shiny lenses with really low f-stops,<br>
Custom-made keyboards with smooth thocky springs;<br>
These are a few of my fave geeky things! </i>😉</font></b>

      I'm told I'm hard to please, but I'd have to argue on the contrary; all I ask for is good value — I expect what I ask for, on time, every time, and at the right price — and not to be taken for an idiot by excepting anything less.

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://hobbycraft.co.uk">Hobbycraft</a> have never let me down, here; ordering is hastle free, delivery has always been well priced and lightning fast, and their packaging is second to none.
</p>
In general, the best storage containers I've found are made by <a href="https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk">Really Useful Products</a> — they’re moulded from polypropylene, they’re translucent (but semi-translusent versions are also available), they’re roomy (without being excessively bulky), they’re very sturdy and well made, they have a nice rectangular interior, they're relatively inexpensive, and they're available in a huge variety of sizes.

<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven't found a more reliable supplier than <a href="https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/">Kenable</a>; from experience, I honestly can't recommend them enough.
