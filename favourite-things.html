      This webpage is currently under construction. I was going to create a ‘name and shame’ page, here, but I’d still be hard at it when the stars burn out; that being the case, I've instead decided to share some of my better experiences.

   <p style="color: grey"> <font size="4"><b><i>
      Linux on smartphones and tablets and desktops, bright shiny lenses with really low f-stops, custom-made keyboards with smooth thocky springs; these are a few of my favourite things! </i></font></b>
   </p>

   <font size="4"> 
      I’ve been told I’m hard to please, but I’d have to argue to the contrary; all I ask for is good value (I expect what I was promised, on time, every time, and at the right price — and not to be taken for an idiot by excepting anything less).

<h2>Storage Containers</h2>
<p>

Good quality storage boxes are truly indespensible, especially when it comes to keeping your gear safe and dry; polypropylene boxes are particularly handy because they're also suitable for storing documents and prints. 
<p>
<a href="https://reallyusefulproducts.co.uk">Really Useful Products</a> offer an impressive range of solutions; all of their boxes are very well made, relatively inexpensive, stackable, and have a nice rectangular interior (they're also available in many different sizes and a choice of several colours). I ordered mine from <a href="https//hobbycraft.co.uk">Hobbycraft</a>; checkout was hastle free, delivery was lightning fast, and the packaging was second to none.

<h2>Power Banks</h2>
<p>
Camera batteries suck, so I always pack a power bank and portable charger in my gear bag; that way, I can charge up the flat battery while I continue to shoot with the other one (and, of course, I can charge other stuff as well).¹ 
</p>
There are lots of good power banks on the market, but there are also a lot of crapy ones; it's well worth doing some research, here (don't take the manufacturer's specs at face value). The power bank that I use hasn't been available for a while, so I can no longer recommended it (which is a bit of a shame as it's never let me down).


<h2>Computer Cables</h2>

For price and speed of delivery, I haven't found a more reliable supplier than <a href="https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/">Kenable</a>; from experience, I honestly can't recommend them enough.


<h2>Water Shoes</h2>

<p>
   Apart from wet weather, nothing ruins my day like sore feet; reliable footware is an absolute must (especially when you're out and about with a camera), and water shoes are a great (if somewhat unconvential) option. 
</p>

The best I've found so far are <a href="https://www.hot-tuna.com/searchresults?descriptionfilter=water%20shoes">Hot Tuna Aqua Shoes</a>; they're well made, comfortable, and comparatively well priced. I ordered mine from <a href="https://sportsdirect.com">Sports Direct</a> (I snagged two pairs for under £20, which also included postage), and I honestly couldn't fault them for their speedy delivery.

<h2>Boonie Hats</h2>
<p>
Boonie hats are a god send; they may look a bit silly (the Aussies call them <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boonie_hat#Australian_Army_giggle_hat">giggle hats</a>, but&nbsp;— <i>unlike that melted nose on your face, there, Bob!</i>&nbsp;— at least you can take them off when the sun goes down. Just about every military force in the world provides them as standard issue (and for damned good reason).
</p>
My favourite one to date is the <a href="https://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk/products/jaxon-james-packable-cotton-boonie-hat-khaki?_pos=5&_sid=d420f47ee&_ss=r"> Jaxon & James boonie</a> (it's a little less Rambo and a little more Lara Croft), and it's saved my skin&nbsp;— <i>quite literally!</i> — on countless occasions. I ordered mine from <a href="https://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk">Village Hats</a>, but lots of different places tend to stock them (the putty version is particularly nice).

<h2>Earplugs</h2>
<p>
I always carry earplugs; your hearing is important, and you never know when you'll find yourself in a noisy situation (I once got very drunk at a nightclub and passed out next to a loudspeaker; I damaged my hearing permanently, and the frequent bouts of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus">tinnitus</a> lasted several miserable years).

¹ <b>A word of caution, though: I strongly suggest reading <a href="https://domvarney.com/2019/04/14/the-great-battery-brawl/">The Great Battery Brawl</a> by Dom Varney before you even think of doing the same — <i>at best, this approach is risky; if you don't know what you're doing, it can be downright dangerous!</i><b>
