## pacman/pamac ##

### Issue: ###

- a package from the AUR failed because the pgp signature(s) could not be varified

### Solution: ###

- `gpg --recv-keys [SIG]`

   replace [SIG] with the signature to be added

## python-pip ##

### Issue: ###

- `ValueError: bad marshal data (unknown type code)`

   (corrupt/incompatible *.pyc file/files)

### Solution: ###

- `find /usr -name '*.pyc' -delete`

   (find and delete all *.pyc files)

- `pacman -S python-pip`

   (re-install python-pip with pacman)
   
   or

- `pamac install python-pip`

   (re-install python-pip with pamac)

### Comments: ###

- deleting all *.pyc files will subsequently remove any corrupted/incompatible *.pyc files

- re-installing python-pip will create a new batch of *.pyc files that will replace those previously deleted

----

## git ##

### Issue: ###

 - a previous commit comment is incorrect and needs to be amended

### Solution: ###

- `git log --oneline --graph`

  (list commits to identify SHA)

- `git rebase -i [SHA]` 

  replace [SHA] with the SHA of the commit that immediately _**proceeds**_ the comment to be amended

- for the comment to be amended, replace the keyword `pick` with the keyword `reword`. Save the file and exit the editor

- amend the commit comment and save the file

- `git log --oneline --graph`

  (list commits to review changes)

### Comments: ###

- an alternative and _much_ quicker solution would be to use the 'reword' option in [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

## git ##
  
### Issue: ###
  
 - the latest commit is incorrect and needs to be removed
  
### Solution: ###
  
 - `git reset --hard HEAD^`
  
   (delete the latest commit and revert to the previous state)
 
 ---- 
 
## makepkg ##

### Issue: ###

  - `fatal: unable to connect to github.com:`
 
    `github.com[0: 140.82.121.4]: errno=Connection timed out`

### Solution: ###

 - `git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/`
 
 ----

## clamav ##

### Issue: ###

- the database signatures fail to update

### Solution: ###

- `sudo rm /var/lib/clamav/*.*`

   (remove contents of the 'clamav' directory)

- `sudo freshclam`

   (update signatures)
   
- `sudo clamscan -r -i / > clamav.log `

   (run full recursive system scan, list positives only, and output results to a text file named 'clamav.log')
   
### Comments: ###

- Windows executables and file wrappers (used with Wine, for example) may produce false positives

----

## gimp ##

### Issue: ###

- Python modules have been removed from the official repository package resulting in Python scripts and plug-ins (such as Resynthesizer) being unsupported and the Python-Fu console becoming unavailable

### Solution: ###

- `pamac install python2-gimp`
  
    (install the Python support modules from the AUR)
    
### Comments: ###
    
- pamac AUR support _must_ be enabled

----

## fiejail ##

### Issue: ###

- apps do not run via firefjail by default

### Solution: ###

- `ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/[appname]`

   repace [appname] with the name of the app
   
   (create a symbolic link for a specific app)
   
   or

- `sudo firecfg`

    (create symbolic links to all sandboxed apps)
    
- `cd /usr/local/bin`

    (navigate to directory where symbolic links have been created)
    
-  `sudo rm -v !("[appname1]"|"[appname2]")`

   replace [appname1] and [appname2] with the names of the apps

    (delete all symbolic links except those required)
    
### Comments: ###
    
- firecfg is the desktop integration utility for firejail - it allows the user to sandbox applications automatically by clicking on desktop manager icons and menus)

- `sudo firecfg --clean` will delete all created symbolic links

---

## FFmpeg ##

### Issue: ###

- 30fps action cam footage needs to be converted to a lower framerate

### Solution: ###

- `[30fps.MOV] -vf minterpolate=mi_mode=mci:mc_mode=aobmc:me_mode=bidir:vsbmc=1:fps=50,decimate=cycle=2,format=pix_fmts=yuvj420p -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -tune film -crf 17 [25fps.MOV]`

  replace [30fps.MOV] with the name of the input file and [25fps.MOV] with the name of the output file
 
### Comments: ###

- set `fps=` value to twice the desired framerate (for example, set `fps=50` for 25fps or `fps=48` for 24fps)
