This webpage is currently under construction (and until I get out of my rocking chair and decide to do something useful, it’s likely to remain so 😴).

      My father once said “better a has-been than a could-have-been.” I ended up as neither; should that concern me? 
      </b>

My plan is to eventually turn this page into a seperate project (with it's own GitHub repo); a place of public rememberance, dedication, and reflection.
