This webpage is currently under construction (and until I get out of my rocking chair and do something useful, itâ€™s likely to remain so&nbsp;ðŸ˜´). As you can tell straight away, I've not got very far with this list; Iâ€™ll get it finished soon, though (maybe&nbsp;ðŸ˜¬).

A very long time ago, way before I got into photography, I used to build my own hi-fi gear; Rod Elliottâ€™s website was (and still is) like a bible to me. If youâ€™re into this sort of thing, youâ€™ll likely have heard of <a href="https://www.sound-au.com">sound-au.com</a>; itâ€™s an extremely informative site (as a bonus, you can also find a rare <a href="https://youtu.be/mjfOTRBqpJw?si=a72Zc66vD0MYtRbY">interveiw with Rod</a> on YouTube).

<h3>
polarbearcamera.com
</h3>

I wouldnâ€™t normally include any retail sites in this list, but <a href="polarbearcamera.com">polarbearcamera.com</a> is an exception. When looking for tools and materials to repair my cameras and lenses, it's always my go-to place (thereâ€™s also an <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/polarbearcamera">eBay store</a> available in addition to the main site). The product range is extensive, and everythingâ€™s shipped from the UK.
