This webpage is currently under construction (and until I get out of my rocking chair and do something useful, itâ€™s likely to remain so&nbsp;ðŸ˜´). As you can tell straight away, I've not got very far with this list; Iâ€™ll get it finished soon, though (maybe&nbsp;ðŸ˜¬).

usedlens.co.uk

Itâ€™s one of those sites where youâ€™ll think "why has no one thought of this before?" If you're looking for vintage camera gear, <a href="https://usedlens.co.uk/">usedlens.co.uk</a> has you covered; just pop your details in the search and get instant results on the fly. The site is constantly maintained and updated by fellow photographer Dan&nbsp;Cooke.

sound-au.com

A very long time ago, way before I got into photography, I used to build my own hi-fi gear; Rod Elliottâ€™s website was (and still is) like a bible to me. If youâ€™re into this sort of thing, youâ€™ll likely have heard of <a href="https://www.sound-au.com">sound-au.com</a>; itâ€™s an absolutely amazing site (as a bonus, you can also find a rare <a href="https://youtu.be/mjfOTRBqpJw?si=a72Zc66vD0MYtRbY">interveiw with Rod</a> on YouTube).

<h3>
polarbearcamera.com
</h3>

I wouldnâ€™t normally include any retail sites in this list, but polarbearcamera.com is an exception; itâ€™s one of the very few UK stores that sells camera tools and materials. Thereâ€™s also an eBay shop available in addition to the main site. The range of goods is extensive and includes a variety of custom made tools and parts.
