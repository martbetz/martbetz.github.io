A very long time ago, way before I got into photography, I used to build my own hi-fi gear; Rod Elliottâ€™s website was (and still is) like a bible to me. If youâ€™re into this sort of thing, youâ€™ll likely have heard of <a href="https://www.sound-au.com">sound-au.com</a>; itâ€™s an absolutely amazing site (as a bonus, you can also find a rare <a href="https://youtu.be/mjfOTRBqpJw?si=a72Zc66vD0MYtRbY">interveiw with Rod</a> on YouTube).
