This webpage is currently under construction (and until I get out of my rocking chair and do something useful, itâ€™s likely to remain so&nbsp;ðŸ˜´). As you can tell straight away, I've not got very far with this list; Iâ€™ll get it finished soon, though (maybe ðŸ˜¬).Â¹

<h3> 
DNGLab
</h3> 

<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/camera-raw/using/adobe-dng-converter.html">Adobe DNG Converter</a> doesnâ€™t work on Linux (you can try to run it in Wine, of course, but itâ€™s far from an ideal solution). Enter <a href="https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab  ">DNGLab</a>: a camera-RAW to DNG file converter that runs in the Linux command line; itâ€™s easy to install, simple to use, and itâ€™s free and open-source.

<h3>
Lensfun
</h3> 

Lenses arenâ€™t perfect; chromatic aberations, geometric distortion, vignetting... all of them need correcting for in post. <a href="https://lensfun.github.io">Lensfun</a> is a free and open-source library of preset optical corrections (and with a little patience and practice, you can even create your own).

<h3>
RawTherapee
</h3>

If your looking for a competent RAW processor, thereâ€™s no need to look any further. Iâ€™ve been using <a href=" https://rawtherapee.com">RawTherapee</a> since I first held a digital camera; itâ€™s multi-platform, itâ€™s packed with useful features, and itâ€™s completely free and open-source (it also supports some terminal commands). 

<h3>
FEH
</h3>

When you need to check photos on the run, a bloat-free, resource-light, and lighting-quick viewer is king. This is where <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/">FEH</a> comes in; just set up a shortcut in your toolbar (configuration is as easy as it is extensive), and youâ€™re good to go. FEH is both free and open-source.

<h3>
ExifTool
</h3>

I sometimes like a little privacy. ðŸ˜‰ <a href="https://exiftool.org">ExifTool</a> is both aÂ Perl libraryÂ andÂ a command-line utilityÂ that, amongst other things, reads and writes to the metadata of media files (third-party GUIs are also available); itâ€™s completely platform-independent, and itâ€™s free and open-source.

<h3>
FFmpeg
</h3>

When it comes to multimedia files, nothing beats <a href="https://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a>; from encoding and decoding to streaming and filtering, Iâ€™ve yet to find a format that isnâ€™t fully supported. FFmpeg is a cross-platform command-line project thatâ€™s free and open-source (though a few GUIs are also available).

<h3>
PeaZip
</h3>

When it comes to archive management, nothing quite matches <a href=" https://rawtherapee.com">PeaZip</a> â€” itâ€™s cross-platform, supports almost every format available, and has a host of jucy features that are simply unmatched (not least of which includes several advanced security features).

<h3>
rsync
</h3>

Backups are really important, but theyâ€™re often a bit of a faff; <a href="https://github.com/RsyncProject/rsync">rsync</a>, a free and open-source command-line tool for syncing files on the fly, takes away all of the pain (thereâ€™s also a GUI you can use should you need to). From PP3s to final edits, Rclone can sync both locally and remotely.

<h3>
Rclone
</h3>

Backups are really important, but theyâ€™re often a bit of a faff (so much so, that I had to say it twice ðŸ˜‰). <a href="https://rclone.org">Rclone</a> is much like rsync, but it backs up straight to the cloud (think Dropbox, for example); itâ€™s a comand-line tool thatâ€™s free and open source (but, once again, GUIs are also available).

     Â¹ Iâ€™m getting there, though. ðŸ˜Š So far, Iâ€™ve ordered the list in relation to my workflow; this may continue or, as more stuff gets added, I might change my mind. ðŸ¤”
