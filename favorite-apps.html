This webpage is currently under construction (and until I get out of my rocking chair and do something useful, itâ€™s likely to remain so&nbsp;ðŸ˜´). As you can tell straight away, I've not got very far with this list;Â¹ Iâ€™ll get it finished soon, though (maybe ðŸ˜¬).

<h3> 
DNGLab
</h3> 

<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/camera-raw/using/adobe-dng-converter.html">Adobe DNG Converter</a> doesnâ€™t work on Linux (you can try to run it in Wine, of course, but itâ€™s far from an ideal solution). Enter <a href="https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab  ">DNGLab</a>: a camera-RAW to DNG file converter that runs in the Linux command line; itâ€™s easy to install, simple to use, and itâ€™s free and open-source.

<h3>
Lensfun
</h3> 

Lenses arenâ€™t perfect; chromatic aberations, geometric distortion, vignetting... all of them need correcting for in post. <a href="https://lensfun.github.io">Lensfun</a> is a free and open-source library of preset optical corrections (and with a little patience and practice, you can even create your own).

<h3>
RawTherapee
</h3>

If your looking for an open-source RAW editor, thereâ€™s no need to look any further. <a href=" https://rawtherapee.com">RawTherapee</a>â€™s been my go-to app since the very first day I started; itâ€™s a multi-platform project thatâ€™s packed with useful features, and itâ€™s free and open-source (itâ€™s also fully supported by a very active community). 

<h3>
FEH
</h3>

When you need to check photos on the fly, a bloat-free, resource-light, and lighting-quick viewer is king. This is where <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/">FEH</a> comes in; just set up a shortcut in your toolbar (configuration is as easy as it is extensive), and youâ€™re good to go. FEH is both free and open-source.

<h3>
ExifTool
</h3>

I sometimes like a little privacy. ðŸ˜‰ <a href="https://exiftool.org">ExifTool</a> is both aÂ Perl libraryÂ andÂ a command-line utilityÂ that, amongst other things, reads and writes to the metadata of media files (third-party GUIs are also available); itâ€™s completely platform-independent, and itâ€™s free and open-source.

<h3>
FFmpeg
</h3>

When it comes to multimedia files, nothing beats <a href="https://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a>; from encoding and decoding to streaming and filtering, Iâ€™ve yet to find a format that isnâ€™t fully supported. FFmpeg is a cross-platform command-line project thatâ€™s free and open-source (GUIs are also available).

<h3>
Rclone
</h3>

Backups are really important, but theyâ€™re sometimes a bit of a faff; <a href="https://rclone.org">Rclone</a>, a free and open-source command-line tool for syncing files to the cloud, takes away all the pain (thereâ€™s also a GUI you can use should you find it helpful). From PP3s to final edits, Rclone does the lot.
