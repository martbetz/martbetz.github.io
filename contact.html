<b>If you’re <i>really</i> desperate, you could always try sending me an <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a>; please note, however, that you'll be sending all your secrets to a disposable <i>public</i> inbox (please visit <a href="https://www.yopmail.com">yopmail.com</a> for more info) — <i>so best not send any weird stuff, Bob!</i></b>

If you’d like me to reply, the forum’s always your best bet. While GitHub doesn’t have a message box, please raise an issue if it relates to the website. If you contact me via email, I won’t respond directly; should your question or comment have merit, I'll post all the details on here.
