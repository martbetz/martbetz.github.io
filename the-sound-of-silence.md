I haven't posted much for quite some time; in short, I'm thinking of shutting this site down.

I'll be sharing full details shortly, so please bear with me for now.

UPDATE - 15/11/2025

Ok, so here's the gist of it. Around two years ago, I started to experience some strange symptoms affecting my general health and mobility. A recent neurology consultation has revealed some issues that, while unlikely to be life-threatening, will likely present with significant progressive physical challenges.

For this, and a few other reasons, I'm placing this project on haitus. I may be back, or I may decide to call it a day; either way, I'll post any updates here.

UPDATE - 28/02/2026

It's been a while, so I thought I'd post an update. 

Back in January 2024, I developed very pronounced and very 'coarse' fasciculations which presented in both legs (thighs, calves and feet); they seemed to appear spontaneously after a particularly challenging ramble. I went to my GP in June of 2024 who gave me a full neuro exam (which I 'passed') but refered me to a neurologist for further investigation.

In May of 2025, I managed to turn my ankle while out on another ramble. I mention this here as by the time I saw the neurologist, in October 2025, I was also presenting with partial foot-drop (which the ankle injury may or may not have contributed to).

Between the onset of the twitching and seeing the neurologist, I was experiencing cramps, stiffness, and fatigue in my legs; I also develiped lower back pain which slowly made walking more and more intolerable as time passed.

​I had another neuro exam, ten viles of blood taken, and an NCS and EMG ordered during my next appointment; the neurologist didn't seem too concerned from the exam in general, but was mindful of my ankle weakness and my inability to stand on my heels.

In December 2025, I had both the NCS and the EMG. Not much was discussed with me, but I could sense the concern over the EMG; the NCS test was apparently normal.

The neurologist wrote to my GP with a diagnosis of Benign Cramp Fasciculation Syndrome in February 2025 — this was a huge relief for me as, for the best part of two years, I was fearing a diagnosis of motor neuron disease.

I started getting on with my life, and wasn't too worried when I attended my next neurology appointment in February 2026. I had another neuro exam, more blood taken, and an MRI booked in (which I'll be having next week). It was then that the neurologist explained to me that my EMG was showing some red flags — based on these results, and combined with my other symptoms, MND would usually weigh in as a very serious contender; however, he didn't believe it was MND in my case as several things (such as the relative length of time involved) just didn't quite fit. 

So here I am. We could be looking at a compressed nerve in my back that's coincidentally accompanied by benign fascicularions and cramps, or we could be looking at a relentless and terminal illness. Only time may truely tell — that is, presuming the axiety and stress don't finish me off regardless.
