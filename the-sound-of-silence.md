I haven't posted much for quite some time; in short, I'm thinking of shutting this site down.

I'll be sharing full details shortly, so please bear with me for now.

UPDATE - 15/11/2025

Ok, so here's the gist of it. Around two years ago, I started to experience some strange symptoms affecting my general health and mobility. A recent neurology consultation has revealed some issues that, while unlikely to be life-threatening, will very likely present ongoing progressive challenges.

For this, and a few other reasons, I'm placing this project on haitus. I may be back, or I may decide to call it a day; either way, I'll post any updates here.
