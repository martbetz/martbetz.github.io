### Why is the code so messy? ###

It’s allowed to be; my website's but a playground.

### How can I reach you? ###

You can [contact me](https://martbetz.github.io/contact.html) directly by email or by chat. 

### Are you on social media? ###

I've no reason to be. I may pop up in the odd forum, but that's about it.

### What are your chosen pronouns? ###

I've no such terms of preference; you can call me whatever you want. 

### Can I meet you in person? ###

Stop being weird.

### Where are you from? ###

The same place as you, most likely: Planet Earth.

### Will you repair my camera/lens? ###

I don't have the resourses to offer such a service.

### Can I hire you? ###

I'm not a professional; I’m just a hippie with some hobbies.

### Can I Contribute? ###

You'd do better posting stuff elsewhere and sending a link to your work.
