### Why is the code such a mess? ###

The website was written on my Kindle. It's also my playground, and Iâ€™m also lazy. 

### Can I leave a comment? ###

No. I don't accept comments on the website.

### How can I reach you?

You can [contact me](https://martbetz.github.io/contact.html) directly by email or by chat. 

### Are you on social media? ###

No. I've no reason to be. I may pop up in the odd forum, but that's about it.

### What are your chosen pronouns? ###

I've no such terms of preference; call me whatever you want. 

### Can I meet you in person? ###

No. Stop being weird.

### Where are you from? ###

The same place as you, most likely: Planet Earth.

### Will you repair my camera/lens? ###

No. I don't have the resourses to offer such a service.

### Can I hire you? ###

No. I'm not a professional photographer; I just like taking pictures and messing about with computers.

### Can I Contribute? ###

No. You'd do better posting elsewhere and sending a link to your work.
