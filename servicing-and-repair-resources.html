<h4> Securing leather/leatherette/PU leather coverings and related fixings </h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40065942/">3M™ 300LSE</a> (transfer tape) - my first choice; it’s much less messy than glue and can often be easier to remove.</li>
<li><a href="https://ruscoe.com/products/adhesives/">Rusco Pliobond® 25</a> (adhesive) - my second choice; for the rare occasions when transfer tape won't cut it (difficult to reach spots, for example, or parts with a degraded surface area). </li>
