<a href="https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html">RawFocus</a> is an independent and modest attempt at a resource page for <a href="https://rawtherapee.com">RawTherapee</a>.

<hr><p><span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
<b>This page is a work in progress, but I’ll finish it  as soon as I can — <i>so just hold on to your rug, there, Bob!</i></b><hr>
</span></p>

Over on the forum, there's been a bit of chatter: how could updates and project news be better served to users? So I typed away on the clacker last night, and this is what I came up with.
