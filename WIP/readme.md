<a href="https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html">RawFocus</a> is an independent and unofficial attempt at a resource page for <a href="https://rawtherapee.com">RawTherapee</a> (in other words, a good old-fashioned newsletter for anyone who cares to read it). 

<p><hr><span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
<b>Please keep in mind that this is both a personal and an experimental project on the part of the website author â€” <i>by choosing to vist this website, youâ€™re declaring your acceptance of itsÂ <a href="https://martbetz.github.io/terms-and-conditions.html#terms">terms</a>.</i></b>

<p>
Over on the forum, there's been a bit of chatter: how could updates and project news be better served to users? So I typed away on the clacker last night, and this is what I came up with.
</p>

<p>
Updating the main project news feed has proven a bit of a faff, so I'm going to host it instead as a page on my personal site (where billions of daily vistors are sure to find it and read it ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜†).
</p>

<hr><p><span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
<b>This page is a work in progress, but Iâ€™ll finish it  as soon as I can â€” <i>so just hold on to your rug, there, Bob!</i></b>
</span><hr></p>

The aim of RawFocus, then, is to compliment the 'news' section of the main RawTherapee website; to provide a greater insight into what's being talked about and what's currently going on with the project.
