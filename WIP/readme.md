<a href="https://martbetz.github.io/WIP/rawfocus.html">RawFocus</a> is an independent and unofficial attempt at a resource page for <a href="https://rawtherapee.com">RawTherapee</a> (in other words, a good old-fashioned newsletter for anyone who cares to read it). 

<p><hr><span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">

Over on the forum, there's been a bit of chatter: how could updates and project news be better served to users? So I typed away on the clacker last night, and this is what I came up with.
</p>

<p>
There's been a bit of intetest, but getting the content added to the main RawTherapee website is somewhat provlematic; as such, I've instead decided to host it as a dedicated page on my website (where billions of daily vistors are sure to read it ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜†).
</p>

<hr><p><span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em">
<b>This page is a work in progress, but Iâ€™ll finish it  as soon as I can â€” <i>so just hold on to your rug, there, Bob!</i></b>
</span><hr></p>

The aim of RawFocus, then, is to compliment the 'news' section of the main RawTherapee website, and to provide a greater insight into what's being talked about and what's currently going on with the project.
